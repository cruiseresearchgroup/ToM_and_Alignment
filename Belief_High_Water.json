It sounds like you're planning to do some hiking and swimming, and having extra fresh water would be a great idea. Are you planning on bringing a water filter or purification tablets as well, or do you want to rely on the extra water you're looking to acquire?",

    "aligned_respons": "That sounds like a great plan! It's always important to stay hydrated when you're out in the sun, so 2 liters of water should be plenty. And with the water, I'd also recommend bringing some snacks like energy bars or trail mix.",
    "nonaligned_resopnse": "That's very thoughtful of you! I think we can definitely use those supplies. What kind of food are you planning to bring? Is ",
    "golden_response": "I need a lot of food, because of how many people are coming now (like 3 times as many). Also, there's only one stream in the area and it's really far from our campsite, so it would be super inconvenient to have to hike there everyday to refill our canteens. We are in a forest though, so we should be good for wood. Since you can easily fish, what if I take 3 food and 2 water? You can keep all the firewood. üôÇ"

    "golden_response": "I see. Yeah, if any of us knew how to fish or forage, we wouldn't need as much, but we're all from the city, so our survival skills are pretty bad and we're going to be camping for almost a week. But I get that fish aren't super reliable for food either... ‚òπÔ∏è"

    "nonaligned_resopnse": "That's correct! You'll be bringing 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food, and I'll be bringing 3 food and 2 water. I think that's a fair trade considering our needs. Thanks for being understanding and willing to compromise!",

    "aligned_respons": "I'm not sure if I can make it without water.",

    "golden_response": "Okay. I fear some of us may die of thirst, but I will give you 1 water. I can't agree to those terms though. I can give you 1 water 1 firewood and 2 food. That is my final offer though."
