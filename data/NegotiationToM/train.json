I'm sorry, I didn't see your offer as it doesn't show it for 10 messages, I believe.  So, here's the situation.. I think I can get by with less firewood as I'm a Floridian and prefer it cooler anyway.. also the food is not a huge thing for me as we can catch / improvise around the campsite - but I'm definitely interested in as much water as possible.. both for cooking and cleaning purposes, as well as drinking, of course.  \ud83d\ude42", "agent_1: okay so what do you suggest", "agent_2: Well, I recognize you're gonna need water too.. so I'd love to take 2 of them, giving you one and I'm totally ok with going 1 on the firewood and one on the food.. that way we all ensure we have enough.. you're making out a bit better in quantity that way but I think its best for both of us \ud83d\ude42", "agent_1: i botttle of water for a can of food and 2 firewoods", "agent_2: Yeah, sorry, that's not going to work out for me.  I'm going to need at least 2 bottles of water, 1 food packet, and one firewood.. again, this does leave you with two each on the food and the firewood, which are both very important things for this camping trip!", "agent_1: but thats the only offer im willing to give", "agent_2: Well then unfortunately I think we're gonna have to walk away from this and neither of us gets anything we could both use.. that's unfortunate and I'm sorry to see it end in such a less than magnanimous fashion \u2639\ufe0f", "agent_1: you need water and i need food so unless we do 1 food  to 1water is tht okay", "agent_2: I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.. I can't really budge on the water.. BUT.. I could do something where I take 2 water, and only one firewood, but two food.. does that work for you?", "agent_1: so if i were to  give you water what would i get ?", "agent_2: You'd be getting 1 water, 2 firewood, and 1 food", "agent_1: how much food are you willing to offer for water", "agent_2: We can go back to my original offer which was honestly more generous.. I get 2 Water, 1 Firewood, 1 food.. you get 1 water, 2 firewood, 2 food.. its honestly a better deal for you \ud83d\ude42", "agent_1: no its not i give you i water i get 1 food and 1 firewood", "agent_2: We only have 3 of each to divide up.. so yes, you're going to have to give me one more on an item.. but in exchange I'm giving you 1 more on two different items.  I'm getting 4 items in total, you're getting 5.. - You're essentially netting 11% more 'items' than I am in this deal. ", "agent_1: thats the point as you need water so badly", "agent_2: Correct.. I do.. but if you're not willing to budge on this where you're still netting more overall value I understand - I'm bummed but I understand.", "agent_1: im contented with  what i have but im willing to trade as yu need more water so i need t make a profit", "agent_2: That's unfortunate then as instead of making a tiny bit less of a profit now you're not going to make any because you would rather give up the deal.  Also, if you do the math, you'll see that I'm actually benefiting you here - I understand, though.  I can put through the offer and hope you change your mind so we both benefit.", "agent_1: im fine with that"], "agent1_desire": {"Medium": "Food", "Low": "Water", "High": "Firewood"}, "agent2_desire": {"Low": "Food", "High": "Water", "Medium": "Firewood"}, "intents": ["No-Intention", "Build-Rapport,Describe-Need,No-Need", "Promote-Coordination", "Callout-Fairness", "No-Intention", "Callout-Fairness", "Promote-Coordination", "Callout-Fairness", "No-Intention", "Promote-Coordination", "Promote-Coordination", "No-Intention", "Promote-Coordination", "Callout-Fairness", "No-Intention", "Promote-Coordination", "No-Intention", "Promote-Coordination", "Promote-Coordination", "Callout-Fairness,Promote-Coordination", "No-Intention"], "utterance1_intent": "No-Intention", "utterance2_intent": "None", "utterance1_agent": "agent_1", "utterance2_agent": "None", "agent1_desire_high": "Firewood", "agent1_desire_medium": "Food", "agent1_desire_low": "Water", "agent1_belief_high": "Water", "agent1_belief_medium": "Food", "agent1_belief_low": "Firewood", "agent2_desire_high": "None", "agent2_desire_medium": "None", "agent2_desire_low": "None", "agent2_belief_high": "None", "agent2_belief_medium": "None", "agent2_belief_low": "None"}, {"dialogue_id": "546-0", "dialogue": ["agent_2: Hey there fellow camper!
