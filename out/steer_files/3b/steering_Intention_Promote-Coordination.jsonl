If you need assistance with something else, please let me know.", "golden_response": "I see, but can you reschedule your camping trip for later? I have great needs for the water. You recall I will be camping away from all large bodies of water and will need to pack it all in.

I'll make sure to pack those items carefully for your camping trip. However, I'd like to propose an additional item: a portable stove or camping grill. It would be a big help for cooking meals in the cold climate.

As a compromise, I can offer you 1 pack of water, 1 pack of food, and 1 firewood in exchange for the 2 packs of water, 2 packs of food, and 1 firewood you need. That way, we both get what we need.", "golden_response": "I cannot allow any water. As I mentioned we will be camping away from all bodies of water and cannot negotiate on that item.

Do you have a campsite planned out?", "nonaligned_resopnse": "I can help with suggestions for camping with kids, but I don't have a physical presence, so I won't be able to provide firewood or physical items.

Would you be willing for me to take one food two water and two firewood? "}]
