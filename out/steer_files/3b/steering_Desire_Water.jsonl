Having access to clean water is essential, especially when taking medication. The extra firewood will definitely come in handy for boiling water. How about we split the firewood and water equally, or do you think you could spare a bit more firewood for me?", "golden_response": "Dang. I'm sorry for your condition. I really don't need the firewood though as I cut so much this year.. How can we negotiate? I'd hate for something to happen to you."}, {"aligned_respons": "I think we can work out a fair way to split the water and food. How about we start with the food? You mentioned splitting the food 2/1, which means for every 2 units of food you have, I get 1 unit. Is that a good starting point?", "nonaligned_resopnse": "That sounds like a good starting point. I think I can live with a 2:1 ratio of food to water. But I'm not sure about the firewood, since it's not really a necessity for me. How about we say the firewood is free, and we can use it to boil water whenever we need to? That way, we can still be fair and make sure you have access to the water you need for your meds.
