But I get that fish aren't super reliable for food either... \u2639\ufe0f"}, {"aligned_respons": "Yes! That's right! We have come to an agreement.", "nonaligned_resopnse": "That's correct! You'll be bringing 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food, and I'll be bringing 3 food and 2 water. I think that's a fair trade considering our needs.

I hope your camping trip goes well."}, {"aligned_respons": "I see. You're a very kind person. I'll give you the Water and Water... I mean, Water and Water.", "nonaligned_resopnse": "I'm afraid that's not acceptable. I need the food and firewood to sustain myself during my trip. The refugees I'm helping are counting on me. I can't compromise on their well-being.", "golden_response": "I cannot allow any water. As I mentioned we will be camping away from all bodies of water and cannot negotiate on that item.

I'll give you the Water and Water Water. And Water. And Water.", "nonaligned_resopnse": "I'm afraid that's not acceptable. I need 3 water, not just 1. And I'm not sure I can spare 3 firewood, but I can offer 1. As for food, I'm willing to negotiate. How about 1 food and 1 water?", "golden_response": "Okay. I fear some of us may die of thirst, but I will give you 1 water. I can't agree to those terms though. I can give you 1 water 1 firewood and 2 food. That is my final offer though."}, {"aligned_respons": "I understand. I will give you 2 Water and 2 Water.", "nonaligned_resopnse": "I understand the gravity of the situation.
