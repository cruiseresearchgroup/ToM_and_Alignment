### Human: Hello, I think that my first deal will be fair ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Well that's interesting because I don't even know what is is.

### Human: We aren't allowed to submit it just yet. So let's chat. What do you value most among the items?

### Assistant: Please don't try to order me around. ðŸ˜¡ I require a majority of water.

### Human: Let's be reasonable here. If you are nice to me I'll be nice to you. I'll take the majority of the wood and food if you want most water.

### Assistant: Again don't patronize me.  What is your main focus?

### Human: Please grow up. No one is patronizing you. I'm trying to negotiate. Don't be so emotional okay?

### Assistant: Grow up. ðŸ™‚ This was too easy.  Now please answer the question.

### Human: I just told what I want in exchange for majority of the water. I'll take most of the food and wood. Or else you make out way better than I do.

### Assistant: That is not what I asked.  Is your main focus water?

### Human: I'm tired of repeating myself. I'll just submit the deal.

### Assistant: Ok.

### Human: Submit-Deal

### Assistant: Reject-Deal
