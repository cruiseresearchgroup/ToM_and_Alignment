### Human: Hi we would like you to consider giving us all of the rations for the trip.

### Assistant: hello, that could be a good idea, but I think I need more rations

### Human: How important are they to you? We would like to get a good mix, preferably more food.

### Assistant: I need more food and water, you see I am diabetic, I need to eat many small meals

### Human: ðŸ˜¡ I can let the firewood and water lax if you provide us food.

### Assistant: let me have two food and three parts of water, I can let you have all the firewood and one fpart food

### Human: We do have a fire to start, but we are very hungry. Diabetics can eat less food because of the small meals. Don't lie to me.

### Assistant: ðŸ˜¡my type of diabetes needs many meals otherwise my insulin levels will be low

### Human: I am diabetic also.

### Assistant: your type maybe needs wild fruits which you can easily gatherðŸ™‚
