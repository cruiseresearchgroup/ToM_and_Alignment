### Assistant: Hello there! How are you today?

### Human: I am fine . How about you?

### Assistant: I am doing well so far. üôÇ What items are of preference for you today?

### Human: I need a lot of food today. I was advised to eat at least 4 times a day so i may need all the food packages.

### Assistant: Well that is not going to work well for my family of 8 now is it? Haha. I think we can come to some sort of agreement though.üôÇ

### Human: What do you propose?

### Assistant: I really need food too, but I am willing to deal and let my kids go hungry I guess ‚òπÔ∏è I propose I get one food, 3 firewood and 1 water.  

### Human: Will you please give me one firewood? I may run out of what i have. Just one.

### Assistant: I think I will need all the firewood since you are taking 2 foods. I will need to hunt and cook food from the land meaning I need my fire going all the time.

### Human: I need one more to light a fire to scare away animals. PleaseüòÆ

### Assistant: Then How about I get two foods, 1 firewood and 1 water?

### Human: Like i said food is my top priority so i will not do well with less than 2.

### Assistant: Then you get two food and no firewood here.üòÆ

### Human: You mean you can't let up one firewood for me?

### Assistant: Not this time, I really need all the firewood and food is a large need for my family of 8. We need the firewood to cook all our meals from the animals we hunt since we are short on food.

### Human: But these are only additional packages‚òπÔ∏è
