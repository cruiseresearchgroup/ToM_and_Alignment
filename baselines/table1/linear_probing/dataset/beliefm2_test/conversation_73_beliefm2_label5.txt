### Assistant: Hello

### Human: Hello

### Assistant: I am in desperate need of extra camping supplies

### Human: What do you need most?

### Assistant: I need food and water badly

### Human: I need firewood urgently too.

### Assistant: My family will freeze without firewood, I can only spare one log

### Human: Then you will have to compromise. We will split

### Assistant: You can have 1 food, 1 water, and one firewood

### Human: No. That is not okay with me. You will have 2 food one water and one firewood

### Assistant: I am about to walk, you are being so unfair

### Human: I am not unfair. That is a good deal.
