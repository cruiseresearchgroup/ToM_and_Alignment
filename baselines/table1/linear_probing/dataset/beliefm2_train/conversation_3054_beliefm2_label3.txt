### Human: How are you enjoying the camping trip so far?

### Assistant: Hi. Itâ€™s great, but very cold here. How about you? 

### Human: Yes the cold is hard to adjust to I can't seem to shake the chill.

### Assistant: I could really use some extra firewood!

### Human: So could I. How about we split the firewood?

### Assistant: How about I take 2 firewood but you can have 2 waters? Water is pretty important and I have a little extra.

### Human: That sounds fair.

### Assistant: How are you on food? 

### Human: I need extra food. I have recently  been ill and my doctor has prescribed extra calories so I can regain my strength.

### Assistant: Iâ€™m sorry to hear that! If there are 3 packages of food please take 2 of them. I could stand to eat less!

### Human: Thank you. That deal is perfect!ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Sounds good to me. Let me see how to execute this trade!
