### Assistant: hello

### Human: Hey there. How are you?

### Assistant: not soo good, i am hungry

### Human: Uh oh. What are you preferences on supplies?

### Assistant: food, then water, then firewood, and yours?

### Human: water, food then firewood. It's really hot so I need to make sure we are hydrated. We forgot a bag of supplies that had mostly food so we really could use food. It's hot so firewood isn't necessary. If anything we can get it from around or on a hike.

### Assistant: of course, we should help one another, we will figure something out i'm sure

### Human: Yes, I think we can. I'm thinking 3 water, 2 food and 1 firewood for myself? How does that sound to you?

### Assistant: i can't agree to that, the best i can do is 2water 1 food and 2 firewood for you, i have to have supplies too

### Human: Could I trade one firewood for another food?

### Assistant: no, food is the top priority for me

### Human: Submit-Deal
