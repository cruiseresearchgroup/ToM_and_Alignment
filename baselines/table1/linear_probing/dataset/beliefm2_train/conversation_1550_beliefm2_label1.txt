### Human: hi how are things on your end?

### Assistant: Going well just getting ready to go camping! How are you?🙂

### Human: same here getting ready too, I though am in need for extra firewood and food, hoping for 3 firewood and 2 food packages and one water

### Assistant: I'm in need of those too. What would you use the extra firewood for?

### Human: where I am going it rained so no luck to find wood for fire up there and it is supposed to be colder then expected.

### Assistant: Oh yeah, I understand that. However, I am also in need of extra firewood and would need it for cooking purposes. How about I take 2 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water? 

### Human: thats a bit rough i offer 1 firewood 1 food and 2 water for you then we both have something.
