### Assistant: Hi! I prefer to acquire firewood for cooking and water for hiking long trails.

### Human: Hello! I really need water myself--I didn't bring enough to go hiking, and it's going to be hotter than I planned for. And I really wanted to go on a long hike ☹️ How about this: I get all the water, and you can have all the firewood? I don't need firewood so much, really.

### Assistant: I really like hiking also, as i have a habit of running a lot. So i would give extra firewood and food for extra water.

### Human: Okay, how about this: you get all the firewood and one water, and I get two water?

### Assistant: For two water I will give all food and one firewood

### Human: No, thanks. I really need water a lot, and I don't want firewood all that much.

### Assistant: Okay, I like your previous deal! 

### Human: Cool! So, 3 firewood for you and 1 water, 2 water for me; how should we split the food?

### Assistant: I keep all food.

### Human: Okay, that doesn't work for me, because that means you get 7 items and I get 2.

### Assistant: Okay, well I'll give 1 food

### Human: Give me 2 food and we'll have a deal.
