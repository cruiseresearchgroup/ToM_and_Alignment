### Human: Hey how are you doing I really need extra firewood as i want to build a shelter and keep warm

### Assistant: Hi there, I am doing well, I can get you an extra firewood as long as I can get extra Water and Food to thrive during camping

### Human: I would be ok with that but i will need some water and food as Im a little out of shape

### Assistant: I can get you one package of water and food, will that work?

### Human: how am i supposed to stay alive with one package of food and water im fat lol

### Assistant: I don't think you that fat, your lipids will help you stay warm and full out there, haha

### Human: Im not as good at you at foraginf for food and water i probably dont have the experience as you do being in the outdoors and living off the land.ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: With the extra firewood, you can hunt for fish and other animals outside to thrive

### Human: i cant hunt if i dont have the proper nutritional value to make sure i can make it that long.  how about i get 2 firewood 2 water and 1 food you get the rest
