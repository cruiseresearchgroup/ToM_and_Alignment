### Assistant: Hi, What do you thing about a deal with me?

### Human: Well, I could really use some extra food, so maybe we can make a deal for some?

### Assistant: I will share 1 food with you. Because my child and wife very hungry past two days. So I feed them.

### Human: Oh my, Do you and your family have enough water for the next few days?

### Assistant: I want 1 package of water for my family. I will share 2 packages of water with you.

### Human: I really don't need that much water, that's why I thinking that maybe you and your family could use it instead.

### Assistant: That's okay. What about the firewood?

### Human: I have some firewood to spare but I think I need to keep at least 1 package.

### Assistant: Okay I will give you 1 package of firewood.

### Human: Since I am traveling alone, I think it's for the best that you get two packages of water, food and firewood.

### Assistant: Okay, I agree the deal. What about you?

### Human: That sounds good to me.
