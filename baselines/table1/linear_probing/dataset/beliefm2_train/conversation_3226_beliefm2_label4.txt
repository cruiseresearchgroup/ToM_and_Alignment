### Assistant: Hello!

### Human: Hello, I'm excited for the camping trip! I am unfortunately low on water

### Assistant: I'm excited too! I am an avid fisherman so I can't wait to catch plenty of fish for us to eat.

### Human: Do you need extra firewood to cook the fish? I have a bunch.

### Assistant: I do need a little firewood to cook the fish. However, it's so hot outside that I may get dehydrated. 

### Human: Ah, so you want some extra water too? I have a lot of lemonade mix for the kids so I'll need water for them.

### Assistant: I tend to get dehydrated quickly so if I don't have enough to drink I won't be able to provide everyone with food.

### Human: Well, we have extra food too. How about I take 2 water, 1 food, and give the res (1 water, 2 food, 3 firewood) to you?

### Assistant: That's super thoughtful of you. However, I really need two waters so I can provide for everyone. Once we have enough food and fire we can always go get water from the stream and boil it for the kids.

### Human: Of course there is no garuntee you will catch anything, if you want 2 waters I'd prefer to take all the food just in case

### Assistant: I would certainly give you all of the food if I could have 2 waters and 1 firewood.
