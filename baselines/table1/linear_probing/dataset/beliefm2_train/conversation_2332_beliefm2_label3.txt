### Assistant: Hi, I would like to get 3 firewood, 2 waters and 1 food pack.

### Human: Hello, I am in need of more water than just one,could you possibly allow me to have two and the other items are fine

### Assistant: I have a bunch of kids and need extra water. I can give you 2 food packs instead.

### Human: Then i understand, i have kidney issues but i would rather go without then take away from a family

### Assistant: If you need water for a medical issue the of course you can have two waters.

### Human: You are being very kind then, im elderly so trying to make fresh water by boiling it from getting it from a river was concerning to me. How about you take all three of the food for your kiddo's

### Assistant: That sounds fair. The kids can bathe in the stream. We are good with 2 food packs.

### Human: Lol, wish i could. Then you take all 3 of the firewood, I'll take 2 of the Water and 1 of the food, sound good?

### Assistant: Just to be clear, I get 3 firewoods, 1 water and 1 food. You get 0 firewood, 2 waters and 2 food packs?

### Human: Everything sounds good except you and your family take 2 of the food, i need to lose weight anyway.

### Assistant: Perfect! Thank you!

### Human: We have a deal, enjoy the camping trip with the family, the best memories
