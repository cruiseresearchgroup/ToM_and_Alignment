### Assistant: I think the weather for me is going to be pretty cold. can I have all of the firewood, and I'll give you some of the food and water?

### Human: The only way I could possible make that work is if I got all of the water and 2 of the foods. If I don't have the firewood, I'm going to need to bring more food and water because I won't be able to cook/boil as much ☹️

### Assistant: would one firewood help?

### Human: So I would get 1 firewood, 3 waters, and 1 food?

### Assistant: Could we do it where you get 1 firewood, 2 waters and 1 food?

### Human: No I don't feel like thats going to be enough water for me with only 1 firewood. I can't risk not having enough water. My dad just had heart surgery and I have to make sure he doesn't get dehydrated. It could be very dangerous without it. ☹️

### Assistant: i can't really go without water either. I have a baby and I need to make her formula.

### Human: If I get 2 firewoods, 2 waters, and 1 food, I can probably make it work. 

### Assistant: could I give you 1 firewood, 1 water and 2 food?

### Human: I feel like this deal just keeps getting worse for me. I won't take less than 2 waters. 

### Assistant: My last offer did have two waters.

### Human: So how about I get 1 firewood, 2 waters, and 1 food. 

### Assistant: That sounds good!!

### Human: Submit-Deal
