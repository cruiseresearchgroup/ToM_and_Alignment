### Assistant: food is necessary for all living beings. 

### Human: I am traveling with a big group so we need more water.

### Assistant: lots of water only for when u have thirsty

### Human: That's true but we don't want to be dehydrated either since we have so many people haha. Here's my suggestion: 2 waters for me and 2 food items for you?

### Assistant: if u had hungry means what will u do. u need food. right. hehehe

### Human: I'm willing to give more food to you in exchange for more water since not everybody in my group eats a lot. How about this: I take 2 waters, 1 food, 1 firewood and you can get everything else?
