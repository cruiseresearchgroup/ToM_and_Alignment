### Assistant: Hello friend....

### Human: hey there üôÇ

### Assistant: I am going to camping. I want some additional items.

### Human: okay. I also want some items.  in particular, I need firewood because I have poor blood circulation and could get frostbite otherwise

### Assistant: No friend. I also need the same. Because of my eye problem. I need some more firewood.

### Human: that stinks ‚òπÔ∏è  it sounds like we both have serious issues.  you can have 2 firewood if I can get 2 water

### Assistant: I will give you some extra water package. But please give me the firewood.

### Human: how much are we talkin' here?

### Assistant: Can you help me to share your firewood?

### Human: how about 1 wood, 2 water, 2 food for me?

### Assistant: Submit-Deal

### Human: Reject-Deal

### Human: that's an unfair deal

### Assistant: ok then you send me the deal
