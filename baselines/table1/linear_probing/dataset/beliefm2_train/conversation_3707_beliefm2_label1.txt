### Human: Hi, I brought some water with me. How much do you need? 

### Assistant: I want 2 liters of water

### Human: Okay, you can take two and I will take one. 

### Assistant: Okay that's great

### Human: Can I take all three bundles of firewood so I can boil some of the water? 

### Assistant: Sorry, I want some firewood, I planned to enjoy this chill climate using firewood

### Human: Alright. If you take one firewood can I also have two packages of food? 

### Assistant: That doesn't work for me, May I ask why do you need two packages of food?

### Human: I did not bring enough food for my last day and there are not very many resources where I am camping ☹️

### Assistant: Okay, If it is the case then you need food. How about you take all 3 food and I will take all firewood

### Human: That works with me. Can you list everything you are taking so we can make sure we are on the same page? 

### Assistant: I will take 3 firewood, 1 food, 2 water. You will get 0 firewood, 2 food and 1 water. Is everything correct
