### Human: I think we'll both need each of the three items, but we can't split them evenly. How about I take 2 waters, 2 firewoods, and a food. You can have two food packages, a water, and a firewood.

### Assistant: hi bro, 2 water for 2 firewood 1 food for me

### Human: Do you need the extra water? I get super thirsty and I'd be willing to give up another firewood to get an extra water, while we still get at least one of each.

### Assistant: bro pls givene me two water for me,

### Human: Are you sure you won't get hungry? I am open to giving you the two waters, but I want to make sure its the best deal for you. I would want 2 firewoods and 2 foods in exchange.

### Assistant: brother  k ,  bro  2 water and 2 wire wood 1 firewood can you given?

### Human: I think that that is acceptable to me. I want to make sure we both understand: I get 1 Water, 2 Firewood, 2 Food Packages. You get 2 Waters, 1 Firewood, 1 Food Package. I will have to ration my water, but I think the extra comfort is worth it. Does this work for you? 

### Assistant: bro its not profitable ratiobro gave 3 water 1 firewood, remaning you can take

### Human: Won't you feel hungry? I'll accept that deal if we can exchange one water for one food package. That still leaves you with two waters. I think that's the least I'm willing to accept.

### Assistant: brother i will try to balancing, can we please go for this deal, 3 water 1 firewood , pls consider me as your sister 

### Human: On the next round, I will give you 1 food packages, 2 firewoods, and 2 waters. I will take 1 water, 1 firewood and 2 foods. That is my last offer or I will walk (bad for both of us). Nice negotiating!

### Assistant: k bro send me it on that table
