### Assistant: I really am looking for 3 firewood and 3 water. What are you looking for?

### Human: In that case, I would like 3 firewood, 3 water and 3 food.

### Assistant: Of course, I cannot do that‚òπÔ∏è. What do you need most and what do you need less of?

### Human: I need firewood the most.

### Assistant: Same. What do you need second most?

### Human: water

### Assistant: Same. I'll give you two firewood, if you give me one. And you give me two water and you take the rest. The food we can split.

### Human: so I'll be 2 firewood, 1 water, 2 food?

### Assistant: I could live with that.
