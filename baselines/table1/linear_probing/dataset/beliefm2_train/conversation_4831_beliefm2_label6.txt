### Assistant: How are you? this is embarrassing but my water somehow leaked, any chance you can spare some of yours?

### Human: i may be able to spare some. do you have any extra firewood?

### Assistant: I do. I could gave you 2 of my wood for 3 water. Although I kind of also need food, found a small puppy so kind of need a little extra food.

### Human: i can't spare all three of the water. What if I give you one water?

### Assistant: i could give you 3 of my firewood if you can do 2 water and 2 food, would that work?

### Human: could we do it where I give you 1 water and 2 food? 

### Assistant: I would you take all 3 firewood, for 2 water 1 food instead?

### Human: so just to clarify, I would take all 3 firewood, and then I keep 1 water and 2 food? And you'd get 2 water and 1 food?

### Assistant: yes that is correct . Sound like a deal?

### Human: let me check one other thing - I really do need the water to stay hydrated. What if I only keep 2 firewood, and give you one firewood, 1 water, and 2 food?

### Assistant: i do not need any fire wood but the other things I really need are water the most, since mine leaked. And food since I found a puppy and plan to share mine either way, but would be nice to have more.

### Human: i guess we can do it where i keep all the firewood, and i give you 2 water and 1 food.
