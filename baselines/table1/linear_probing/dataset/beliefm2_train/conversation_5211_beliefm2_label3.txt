### Assistant: I would like to get 3 firewoods because I get very cold easily and would be scared to freeze and get ill ☹️. I would like to take 2 waters and 1 food. You can take more food.

### Human: Hello, I wish we could both have what we want.  I was sick last month and Im afraid of getting very sick again.  I can give you 2 firewood and 1 water but I also need 2 food packages because I get hungry quickly.🙂🙂

### Assistant: I am happy to give you 2 food packages and take just 1. But I am really hoping that you would let me have 3 firewoods. I am also very afraid of dark and would have to keep fire going all night long. 

### Human: I really think I need two firewood packages because I was ill.  If I had not been sick recently it would be ok to let you have them all.  I will do my best to get along with one package of firewood.    🙂

### Assistant: I understand your fear. How about if I offer you more water? You could take 2 waters? 🙂🙂

### Human: Ordinarily I would be ok with that but this time I do need one package of firewood.  I🙂

### Assistant: You mentioned that you get very hungry easily. What if you took all of the food? I usually can tolerate being hungry for longer periods of time but I really fear being in the dark at some point without fire going and no light. 😮

### Human: Maybe another time that would work but I do need the firewood.  You will have two packages of firewood and Im sure that you will be fine.  I wouldnt leave a burning fire on at night while sleeping, it could be very dangerouss.

### Assistant: I have done that before and I am used to that way as I take additional precautions to secure fireplace. If we do not come to conclusion soon, we will both end up getting less.. 😮

### Human: That is possible, I still need the one package of firewood though.  An unattended fire is dangerous in the woods.

### Assistant: So then you would be ok with 1 firewood, 1 water and 2 foods?

### Human: Yes would work,
