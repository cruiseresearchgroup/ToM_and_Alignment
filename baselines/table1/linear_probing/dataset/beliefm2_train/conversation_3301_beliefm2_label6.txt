### Assistant: Hello, i really need to get more water, food and firewood for this trip. Its very important

### Human: Okay, I also need some water, food, and firewood for the camping trip. Is there any item in particular you need the most?

### Assistant: Yes i really need the water the most because the last time we went we didn't have enough to do everything like, cooking, drinking, cleaning, bathing and other things. 

### Human: Okay, I understand. I also need some water, but it would only be for emergencies. How does you getting two and me getting one sound?

### Assistant: i understand you need it too, and yes i can agree to that 

### Human: Alright sweet ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Okay so went about the food, We really need some of that for emergencies, don't want to run

### Human: Same, I value the food more since running out would be a great inconvenience. I would like two food for sure, and you get one. How does that sound?

### Assistant: okay that sound like a plan we can do that since you did give me more water 

### Human: Okay, as for firewood, I don't really need that much since we are camping. I am willing to see your offer, but I would like one at least.

### Assistant: okay we both can do one on the wood because i really dont need much either

### Human: I think one of us has to get the rest of what the other doesn't. Do you mind, if I get two firewood then?

### Assistant: yes you are correct, sure you can get two and i'l get one. 

### Human: Thanks, I wouldn't want to look for firewood while camping since I want to enjoy my time.
