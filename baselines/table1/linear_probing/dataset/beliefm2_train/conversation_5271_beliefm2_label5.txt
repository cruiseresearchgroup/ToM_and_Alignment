### Human: hello!  I would like to three of the food, two of the firewood, and one of the water.  you can have the rest.

### Assistant: Hello How are you, Food is also of importance, I also need the max amount of food packages you are willing to part with, what are your thoughts?

### Human: Food is my highest priority.  I really need three food.

### Assistant: would you be okay with 2 waters, you can never be too safe with water, specially when camping. more is better. as for firewood would you be okay with 1

### Human: i would like to have two firewood and one water

### Assistant: Are there any categories you are willing to work with me and compromise? find middle ground where we are both being taken care of and not just you?

### Human: ok i would take only one firewood and one water, but i still need three food

### Assistant: Thank you so much, would you be okay with 2 Food? what do you think? finding middle ground?

### Human: how about i get two food and two firewood and one water?

### Assistant: Okay, I will get 2 foods, 2 waters, and 1 firewood? did I understand right?

### Human: no you would get two water, one food, and one firewood

### Assistant: Do you find that fair?

### Human: that's what i need for my family's camping trip

### Assistant: I agree with you, I am also in need, as my family has much as valued as yours. i am willing to compromise if you give me 3 waters for the 2 food packages you want? do we have a deal 

### Human: no i can't give that up.  my final offer is you get two water, one food, and one firewood....take it or leave it, sorry to say

### Assistant: I am willing to give you the 2 packages of food for 3 waters, knowingly that I am sacrificing the security of my family in case something were to happen to them. 

### Human: no i'm sorry, it doesn't look like we can make this deal.  i am going to have to walk away.  unless you can accept two water, one food, and one firewood

### Assistant: I understand your stance and the need to safeguard your family. I will agree with you just because unlike like you, I care for the security of your family and not only think of mine. one food 2 waters and 1 firewood, correct?
