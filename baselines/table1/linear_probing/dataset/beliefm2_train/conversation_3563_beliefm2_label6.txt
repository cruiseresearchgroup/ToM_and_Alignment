### Assistant: Hello there, How would you feel about trading supplies in this manner. 2 Water for me and 2 food , while you get 1 Food , 1 Water , and 3 Firewood?☹️

### Human: While that does sound like an okay deal I would much rather want more water. It is essential to satisfy thirst.

### Assistant: What if I give you an extra food?😮

### Human: Sorry I would really like more then 1 water 😡

### Assistant: Well I would really like 2 waters. Is there anything else you had in mind?

### Human: I get 3 waters and you can have everything else.🙂

### Assistant: I am going to have to refuse that. I would want at least 1 water. ☹️

### Human: What about 2 waters for me and 1 food and you can have everything else?🙂

### Assistant: That sounds promising but if possible I would like two waters.

### Human: Forget it then , dont take that deal then. 😡

### Assistant: Water is extremely important for me as it makes the whole day better in general.☹️

### Human: As it is for me. I am not budging. Take it or leave it.
