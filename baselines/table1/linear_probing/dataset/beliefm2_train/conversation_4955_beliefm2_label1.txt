### Assistant: Hello, how are you? I was wondering if I can get all 3 Firewood? I am taking over 20 members with me, lots of bonfires happening, plus its the summer, bugs will be ready to attack lol, If thats okay with you? what do you think?

### Human: I am good, thanks for askingðŸ™‚ I also need firewood, as we will be tent camping and have cool evenings in the desert.  My greatest need is water, however.  I could part with two firewood packages if you can give me all the water and 2 food packages.

### Assistant: Sounds like a fun trip! would you compromise? we are staying by a river, We can purify our water, would you be okay If I get all 3 Firewoods and you'll get all 3 waters? Will that be okay with you?

### Human: I could do that if you can give me all the food.  Without the extra firewood, we will have to use all we have now for warmth in the evening, and will not have enough to cook with.  Thus, we would need to bring more prepared food and food that does not need to be cooked.  

### Assistant: I completely understand your concerns. I do believe its an unfair trade, i will only have 3 firewoods and 0 foods, and 0 waters. I have a large group, I need to have at least one food. What do you think, I do appreciate you working with me. 

### Human: I see what you mean . . . I can settle for 2 foods packages instead of 3.ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Thank you! taking alot of kiddos with me, they are little rascals, they eat everything onsite. On my end I will be getting 3 firewoods, 1 food, and 0 waters. 

### Human: You are welcome . . . It sounds like we are ready to finalize?

### Assistant: Yes, we are, I do believe we need to have 10 conversations before we can submit? 

### Human: That is correct.  Just to confirm, we have agreed that you will take three firewood and and 1 food--I will take three water and 2 food.ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Yes, submitting deal on my end! Hope we get to work in the future again, have a wonderful day. ðŸ™‚

### Human: Submit-Deal
