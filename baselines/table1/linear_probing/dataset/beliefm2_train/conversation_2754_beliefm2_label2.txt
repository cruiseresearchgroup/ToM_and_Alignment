### Assistant: Hello I am a diabetic so I was wondering if I could get the majority of the food?

### Human: I understand your need. How about i get all the firewood and 1 package of food and 1 package of water as i am stuck in a dense part of the forest without the ability to hunt.

### Assistant: That is an aggressive offer. Why do you need firewood and water if you can't hunt? Wouldn't you need food?

### Human: The area i am in is damp and i do not have the ability to start a fire and stay warm. 

### Assistant: If you get all the firewood I must get all the food then. 

### Human: If i agree to that then i want 2 packages of water as well. 

### Assistant: No I want the two packages. 

### Human: I am sorry but i have to have water if you have all the food.

### Assistant: Guess we're not making a deal

### Human: That's too bad

### Assistant: Submit-Deal

### Human: Reject-Deal

### Human: Please recall i am in the damp area of the forest and need to have firrewood to start a fire and survive. The min i need is 2 packages of water. Please help me

### Assistant: I don't care. 

### Human: I am disabled and trying to find water in the forest will be very difficult. 

### Assistant: Right....... I'm diabetic I need all the resources.
