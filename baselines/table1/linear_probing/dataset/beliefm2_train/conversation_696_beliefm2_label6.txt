### Human: Hello, I was hoping we can chat. 

### Assistant: Hi there. 

### Human: So why did you decide to come camping?üôÇ

### Assistant: I think it will be fun. I was wondering what your preferences are for the extra items we can bring?

### Human: I was hoping for food as I forgot a bag at of stuff at home. I also was hoping to star gaze but I may not have enough wood to keep warm.

### Assistant: I understand. I too would really like some food because I would get pretty hungry without it and I also forgot to bring some. Firewood is so important for keeping warm. There are three of each item. Maybe we can negotiate on how to split the resources

### Human: I don't need any water and I did bring a small amount of food. How about you take 2 food and 1 firewood.and 2 water

### Assistant: I really could use a little more firewood. Thank you for the water. That is very helpful. I am just worried I will not have enough wood to boil it. 

### Human: I think i can give 1 more fire wood.üôÇ

### Assistant: So, that would be 2 firewood, 2 food and 2 water for me and one of each to you? Thank you 

### Human: I would really like to come out of this with a bit more. How about 2 food for me and 1 firewood and water?

### Assistant: What are your current requirements on food so I can better understand your situation?

### Human: ‚òπÔ∏è I forgot most the food I was going to bring and only have enough for less than half the planned trip.

### Assistant: I understand. I guess we are in the same predicament. I have two kids with me though and they are hungry too. How long are you camping for? We are here a week.

### Human: I let my two girls bring their friend. Its their first overnight trip for more than a night. We also had a week planned.

### Assistant: My kids really eat a lot. But then yours probably to as well!

### Human: Can we agree on 2 food for me and 1 water and firewood

### Assistant: How about if I give you 2 water and I take the 2 food?

### Human: I don't need water I have plenty of water. You said you needed wood to boil the waters. So I offered more wood.

### Assistant: Okay, how about this. I understand that you have more kids than me and there are only limited resources. Let's agree that you get 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood
