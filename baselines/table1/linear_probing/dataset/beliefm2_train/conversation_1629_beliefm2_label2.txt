### Human: Hi. Water is very important to me. 

### Assistant: Hello, I don't really need water

### Human: What is it that you need?

### Assistant: I need food and firewood

### Human: I need water and then firewood

### Assistant: You can have all the water if I can have all the extra food

### Human: OK, but first tell me why you need extra food

### Assistant: I have 10 people in my group

### Human: I see. I need more water because I came across some people who were lost and they are very dehydrated.

### Assistant: I need 2 firewood because it gets below freezing at night

### Human: Oh I wouldn't want for you to freeze‚òπÔ∏è It also gets cold where I am, so I need 2 firewood as well.

### Assistant: IF I can't get 2 pieces of firewood, I will walk away

### Human: oh that is too bad. I feel the same way.üòÆ

### Assistant: Sorry we could not come to a agreement, I am walking away
