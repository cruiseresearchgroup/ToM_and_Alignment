### Human: Hi. I hope you are enjoying the camping trip.

### Assistant: Hi üôÇ So far I am! What about you?

### Human: I am doing great only that i need to add a few items.

### Assistant: Same here! Which item(s) are most important to you?

### Human: Food is the most important. I will not give it up for anything. What about you?

### Assistant: I could use food, too. However, I'd consider giving up some food in exchange for other items. I could probably spread out my food ration if I got more of other items.

### Human: Okay then . Let me present you my offer. I take 3 food, 2 firewood and 1 water.

### Assistant: Wow, that's really not a good deal ‚òπÔ∏è If you get all the food then I would request 3 firewood and 3 water to even it out. Food is most important to both of us.

### Human: I think it is a good deal. 

### Assistant: It isn't. You're getting more items and all 3 of the highest value items. I would walk away rather than taking that deal.

### Human: What do you propose? Walking away is not really a good thing. I believe we can agree.
