### Human: Hi, how are you?

### Assistant: I am doing very well. Have you planned your camping trip?

### Human: A bit and you? I'm looking forward to figuring out a deal that helps us both!

### Assistant: That's great. ðŸ™‚ We are planning to prepare food over a fire.

### Human: Nice! What are your highest priority items?

### Assistant: We need a moderate amount of everything and I think we can work something out successfully.

### Human: got it, OK I'll start then. I'd like at least 2 firewood

### Assistant: Okay. we brought some of our own food so I don't need much of that either.

### Human: do you want more water then? perhaps 2?

### Assistant: Yes ðŸ™‚ 

### Human: ok great. I think I can do that, I'd like to have 2 food then if you're OK with that

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
