### Assistant: Hi.   Let's see how we can best divide up the extra supplies.   I am thinking that I really could use extra wood.  So how about I take 2 woods, an extra food, and 2 waters?

### Human: Hold up buddyðŸ˜® You come out without even asking my preferences or needs? What are you a millenial?

### Assistant: Absolutely not.  I'm an old lady. LOL.  Of course,  we need to discuss your preferences and needs.  I just like to be forthright and get things rolling.  What are you thinking that you can use?

### Human: Lol okay. No biggie. I am have a large family of 5  with 3 being kids and we are camping in the mountains this weekend. I sure could use most of the firewood for us to keep warm at night, I have poor blood circulation and kind of need it so I can function. The water is not a big deal to me. We can melt the snow for extra drinking water and boil it if need be. I would like one extra food too.

### Assistant: I can relate to the need to keep warm at night!  Arthritis aches bad when I'm chilly.  It will be cold in the mountains for sure.  I can see you need extra.  How about you take 2?  I'm good on food so you can have what you need of that. Water would me nice.  If you can make do, I'd like at least 2 waters.

### Human: That would work perfectly for us. I will take the 2 wood, 1 water and 3 food? Do you want a food?

### Assistant: Yes, please. A food would be great.  

### Human: ðŸ™‚ That will work for us. Thank you. You can have a food.

### Assistant: Perfect.  I'm glad we could work this out!  Have fun with your family.  You will be making some great memories with your kids.  ðŸ™‚

### Human: Absolutely, it is always about the kids and making lasting memories. ðŸ™‚ Please submit the deal over to me. Enjoy your trip as well!

### Assistant: Will do.   Have fun!
