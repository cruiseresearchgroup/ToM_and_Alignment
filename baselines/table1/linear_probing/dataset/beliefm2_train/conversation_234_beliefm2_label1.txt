### Assistant: Hello, how are you? What packages are of most interest to you?

### Human: I would really prefer to get all the food packages

### Assistant: I would need to have atleast one food package. I have a health condition that requires I eat a little bit more plus I have a large family. What are your thoughts with the water? 

### Human: I get that, I would like 2 packages of food at least, if that's the case. I would like some water because I would need to use it to cook the food.

### Assistant: Would I be able to have one water and one food? ðŸ™‚

### Human: why do you need the water?

### Assistant: I have a large family and we drink a case a day. Why do you need all the water?

### Human: I share my food with others and I need it for cooking. 

### Assistant: How about you get 2 water, 2 food and I get all 3 firewood?

### Human: that sounds like a really good idea actually

### Assistant: Sounds like a plan I will submit the deal.

### Human: awesome
