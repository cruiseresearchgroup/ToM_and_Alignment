### Human: So I was thinking I'd take 2 waters and only 1 of the firewood and food.

### Assistant: Would you be open to doing that the other way around?

### Human: I don't know.  I really don't think I have enough water to cover all the hiking.  I could definitely use extra.  

### Assistant: Yeah, I'm in the same boat, I'm one of those types that is overly cautious and like having as much water as possible, just in case.

### Human: Hm.  Well what about firewood?  How are you with that?  

### Assistant: I could do with or without a fire, it's not a top priority like food and water

### Human: Well I have trouble with starting fires, so the extra firewood would be beneficial to me...I know I'll need a fire going each night.  So what if I took all 3 firewood and then you could have the majority of the water?

### Assistant: so you would get 1 water, 1 food and 3 firewood?

### Human: I would be interested in negotiating for a little more food in that case, but yes, otherwise that is what I am proposing. ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: well, that would put you at 6 items and me at 3

### Human: Well you didn't really need the firewood right?  I, on the other hand, could use all of it.  If I'm willing to take only 1 food package, are you good with the deal?

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
