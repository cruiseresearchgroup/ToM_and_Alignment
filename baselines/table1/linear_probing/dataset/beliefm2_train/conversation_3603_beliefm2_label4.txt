### Human: Hi, I will need alot of water as I need it to stay alive.

### Assistant: I agree, with camping i feel there are many uncertainties. Finding clean water would be too difficult, best to take as much water as possible. 

### Human: I will also need some Firewood too to start a fire

### Assistant: I feel for firewood we dont need as much, as we are going to be camping, with that means, in my opinion, with branches and brush available, maybe we can take 2 fire woods, what do you think?

### Human: Since I got some food already, can I get 3 water, 2 firewood and 0 food then?

### Assistant: can we do at least one food? if thats okay with you? I would like to have extra food in case something happens, i will be able to have the extra supplies. 

### Human: ok, so list out the amount you need

### Assistant: water 3, firewood 2, and food 1, do you agree?

### Human: so you need 3 water, 2 firewood and 1 food?

### Assistant: Yes, I need 3 waters and 2 firewood and 1 food. I really believe the extra supplies will bring comfort in case something were to happen. what are your thoughts?

### Human: sorry, but I need alot of water too, you cannot get all 3

### Assistant: would you compromise with 2 waters, 2 firewood, and 0 food? 

### Human: most i can do is you get 2 water, 1 firewood and 0 food

### Assistant: Yes, thats fine, 2 waters, 1 firewood and 0 food, do we have a deal?
