### Human: I would really like 2 packages of firewood and 2 of food. But I can do with one package of water. 

### Assistant: Okay I can agree to 2 of the water.

### Human: I already don't drink much water so I can get away with 1. üôÇ I am worried about not having enough food because I am pregnant. 

### Assistant: I can give you all 3 of the food, if you can give me 2 of the firewood because I am going somewhere really cold and need the wood to make fires.

### Human: I would worry about you not having any food! I am always cold and feel like I will be freezing and lose to much body heat if I don't have enough firewood. 

### Assistant: I am not worried about food, I have plenty but I need at least two of the firewood for where I am going.

### Human: I'm not sure how to make that work. ‚òπÔ∏è I wonder if the extra food would help keep me warm?

### Assistant: You would still have one of the firewood but a good amount of food since you are pregnant. Perhaps you could bring warm soups or cocoa.

### Human: Yes, that might work! Maybe my extra fat will keep me warm! üòÆ

### Assistant: So we can do 3 food for you, 1 water, 1 firewood, and 0 food for myself, 2 water, and 2 firewood?

### Human: I would be happy with that if you think you will be okay with it! üôÇ

### Assistant: Yes
