### Assistant: Hi there.  I'm looking for some water and firewood.

### Human: Howdy! Water and Firewood. Looks like someone left 3 foods, 3 waters, and 3 firewoods. Perhaps we can split them. I need food because of a raccoon.

### Assistant: Pesky raccoons!  I tend to get dehydrated so extra water is essential for me.  A bit of extra firewood is always good to keep warm and get the smores made.

### Human: I really dont need any firewood so perhaps you could have all the wood, and I could have the food splitting the water 2 for you and 1 for me. Sound good ?üôÇ

### Assistant: I definitely don't mind giving you all the food since I'm dieting lol but maybe one more water so 2 for me and one for you?  I have a bad habit of getting dehydrated ‚òπÔ∏è

### Human: Ok! Thought thats what I wrote, but no harm no foul. Up for a hike after we get this taken care of? Its a little early yet.

### Assistant: That sounds wonderful to me!  Can always do up some food and smores afterwards!  Although might best if you cook the food, unless you like to eat charcoal lol :D  Also yes I do apologize I read that incorrectly!  There's that dehydration lol 

### Human: Cool. üôÇ So do you do any running? Would like to do some trail running, but need to check out the trails first. 

### Assistant: Ungh I am nowhere near enough in shape to run, unless something is chasing me, but if that is the case then I shall valiantly stay behind on the trail to defend you while you run üôÇ

### Human: Well, valiantly eh? Ok. I guess I only need to out run you when the bear chases us. Some idiot in Europe got too close to a bear for a selfie. Too funny. 

### Assistant: Ohhh no!!  That doesn't sound like a very bright idea.  I doubt you'll have any issue outrunning me!  So before I forget, again, 2 water to me, 1 to you, I get all firewood and you get all the food?
