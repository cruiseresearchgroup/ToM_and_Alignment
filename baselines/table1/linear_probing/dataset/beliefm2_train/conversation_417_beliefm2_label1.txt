### Assistant: Hello How are you? ðŸ™‚

### Human: Hello there I'm well. How about yourself?

### Assistant: I'm good. I'm excited for the camping trip. I have been planning this for a few weeks. I'm excited to get out into the woods.

### Human: Oh great! I love getting out into nature.

### Assistant: Do you have any preferences in regards to the firewood, food, and water? I would like us both to get what we need.

### Human: I get really cold at night so I'd like to have extra firewood. 

### Assistant: Same. Plus I am planning on keeping a fire long into the night. Eating alot of food also helps keep you warm while sleeping. Perhaps I could offer you some extra food in return for some extra firewood?

### Human: Hmm I will have to think about this offer. How do you feel about the water packages?

### Assistant: I am a water junkie day to day but the place I am camping as a stream and I'm taking my water filter system, so I could offer you extra water in this case.

### Human: That is very considerate of you. ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Submit-Deal

### Human: Reject-Deal
