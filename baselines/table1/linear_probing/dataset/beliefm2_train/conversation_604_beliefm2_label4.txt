### Human: Hello. Are you ready to play let's make a deal? 

### Assistant: Hello, yes I am.  What do you want?

### Human: Firewood is my highest priority item. 

### Assistant: That's cool, I won't need much.  Water is my main priority.

### Human: Okay. What if I give you two packages of water? 

### Assistant: I really need all three, since I do a lot of hiking.  I was thinking I get all the water, I'll give you 2 of the firewood and two of the food.

### Human: I need water too. 

### Assistant: Hmmm, okay.  How bout you get one water, two firewood, and one food?

### Human: If we do that then you will get five packages of items, while I only have 4. That's not fair. How about I get 2 firewood, 1 water and 2 food. 

### Assistant: That sounds fair to me.  Do we have a deal?

### Human: Yes

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
