### Assistant: Hi there - I need extra firewood

### Human: So do I. I have a medical condition that causes my veins to close when I get cold. ☹️

### Assistant: I really need it for my children who get cold at night and we read bedtime stories, so need to be able to see.  Lastly, I really need it to warm up a bottle for my baby.

### Human: You have kids!🙂 Do you need extra food? I'm on a diet, so I don't eat so much.

### Assistant: I have food because my baby is mostly on bottled milk. Can I 2 firewood and 2 waters to mix up the formula?

### Human: I would be willing to give you two waters if I could have two firewood. I don't want my veins to close and freeze to death.

### Assistant: I understand, but I really need the firewood for my kids. There are 4 of us.

### Human: I understand, but if my veins shut down I could die.

### Assistant: Alright alright... I'll give you 2 firewood for all the food and water 🙂

### Human: 😮 How about 1 firewood, 2 waters, and 2 food for you. 2 firewood, 1 water, and 1 food for me?

### Assistant: How about 1 firewood and 3 waters for me... sorry but my baby could die if she doesnt eat. and 1 food for you?

### Human: I'll let you have the three waters. If I could have 2 food. That way things are mostly split down the middle.

### Assistant: fine thanks!
