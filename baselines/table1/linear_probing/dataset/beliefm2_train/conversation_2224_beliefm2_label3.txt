### Human: I am giving you all the water,  how come you need the food? 

### Assistant: The main reason is to prevent us from cold.  Please provide three wood and three water.  If this is okay, then I will provide you three food.

### Human: Food doesn't prevent cold. Thank you for giving me all the food but I need 1 wood to cook the additional food. You still end up with more items in the  end  

### Assistant: Okay I accept the deal.

### Human: ðŸ™‚awesome thank you

### Assistant: Sorry, I thought that I can manage with two woods, but the temperature is very loo and many people need to save their life.  Please change the deal and provide us 3 wood.
