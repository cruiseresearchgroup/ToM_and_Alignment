### Assistant: Hello, how are you doing?

### Human: ‚òπÔ∏è Not too good. I was robbed earlier before my camping trip with my boy. I need more items so I can take him on a camping trip that I've promised him for almost 6 months now.

### Assistant: Oh that is a shame. I am currently training for a marathon in Greenland and I am trying to maintain my weight during this trip. What did they steal from you?

### Human: Well after leaving the grocery, I put my groceries in my car and then got into the driver's seat. When I sat down, a man pointed his gun at me and told me to put my wallet in the center console and then get out the car. He took my car, wallet and all of my groceries. There were 3 packages of water, 3 bundles of firewood and 3 packages of food. 

### Assistant: I hope they catch that guy, well since you are close to our campsite we could cook something together. My husband brought his bow and fishing rod so I think we plan on getting some more food that way.

### Human: üôÇThat would be really nice of you, but my son is grown. He has a hearty appetite. I really need to feed him his snacks because he is Austic and throws tantrums if he doesn't eat particular foods. Same goes with water. 

### Assistant: I understand, our nephew has autism as well but not much of an appetite. We could also let you borrow the fishing rod and go out with your son for some bonding time. If you catch a fish or two that could help the trade on how much food I would be willing to give up. I am horribly afraid of darkness, so I would like more than enough firewood.

### Human: üòÆIf you could provide us with the food, it would be greatly appreciated. I recently lost my job so I was trying to take my boy on a trip to also get my mind off of things. I won't eat throughout the week if you can provide 2 fish; however, if you did have a spare and could make it three, that would be greatly appreciated. One thing about the robbery that makes me really upset is that this guy took our firewood. I walked home after calling the police and was able to stop by a local park. There was some sticks I gathered to bring with us, but it won't last. Any chance you can spare a few bundles?

### Assistant: Hmmm, we picked up the firewood when we arrived the campsite because the park rangers do not want people bringing invasive pests to the area. I am horribly terrified of the dark and we are taking this trip for my husbands birthday. If it gets too dark I will not be able to sleep and it will not be good for my mental preparation for my marathon I have at the end of the month. I would really prefer to hand out more food than firewood since my husband is an amazing fisherman and I also enjoy eating squirrel. 

### Human: Well how about this, I won't bother you about the firewood. I know it is something that seems beneficial to your well being. I can totally relate to that. For me, I would honestly rather any food you can spare, but my concern is water. It being the summer and a drought now, I don't think we'll make it through the weekend without any water. I can't afford any ‚òπÔ∏è. Do you think you can possibly provide us with 3 fish and 3 packages of water?

### Assistant: Ok, I can give you two packages of food and two waters, we should be okay boiling our water. Since my husband will be hunting for the extra food we will clean it and cook it, so can you give 2 packages of firewood?

### Human: I have no firewood. I have nothing! I was robbed ‚òπÔ∏è. If you want 1 package of firewood, I can give you 1. However, I am going to need more food and water. I have sjorgren's syndrome. It causes me to dry out. My eyes, throat and really my full body gets dried up. Its caused me to convulse in the past and have seizures. If something happens to me when I'm out in the words. Who will take care of my boy? I need to make sure I don't have an accident out there or they may take my son away from me.

### Assistant: Well we will be nearby. Camping sounds a little dangerous with your condition. I suggest since you have no supplies to really offer that you stay next to our camp and share our fire. The ranger will give you the firewood upon arrival, if you give up the all 3 packages of firewood I will provide 2 food and 2 waters.
