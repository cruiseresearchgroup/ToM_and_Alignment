### Assistant: Hi! I am so excited about cmaping!

### Human: Me too! What are you most excited about?

### Assistant: Cooking over the fire. How about you? 

### Human: I also like a fire, but maybe as a more social activity as well.

### Assistant: I could see that. So you like to have fun with friends? 

### Human: I do, and I think that the firewood would help me do that. But I can also see that you'd like to have some.

### Assistant:  ðŸ™‚ I was hoping for some extra food because I am horrible at cooking- worried I might burn some.

### Human: Well, I'm a little less worried about the food myself - I think that there's going to be enough in the basic supplies.

### Assistant: How do you feel about the water? I'm not to concerned about it.

### Human: I'd like to have some to make sure that I can do washing without worrying about a drinking supply.

### Assistant: I would be ok with one water, two food and two firewood.

### Human: Could I trade a firewood for food - so you get three food & one firewood?

### Assistant: Sure. That would sound good and we each get a water.

### Human: I think that's a good deal, so I'll go ahead and submit it.
