### Human: Hi thereðŸ™‚

### Assistant: How are you hope you are excited. 

### Human: Yes cant wait for the trip

### Assistant: So I was wonder what you need distributed well see if we can work somethign out

### Human: Well due to a medical condition i need to eat more just for my body to be normal. It also leaves my body temperature colder which could lead me going into shock. I do need All the food and firewood

### Assistant: Thats allot and wouldn't be good for me and my daughter I am willing to spare you the firewood and but will be needing 2 food and all of the water. I will give you all of the firewood.

### Human: I need to eat more due to my condition 3 wood 2 food me 1 food 3 water you

### Assistant: I understand that I hope you will be able to make he trip. 3 extra wood for one person you must have a serious condtion. It is a bit high given there are are more of us; I would be willing to distribute 3 food if I get all of the others 

### Human: Here how but this, 2 food me 2 firewood and 1 water

### Assistant: I still dont see how that can be justfied given you are one person? maybe you shouldn't take the trip. As a distributor I like to hear all sides and reasons but I am concerned that its so one sided  

### Human: Oh you think its just me? I have a family of 6

### Assistant: you have stated it was just you using verbs like me and I.

### Human: You know what if you want to get caught up in pendantics we can just have no one get anything

### Assistant: That wouldn't help any of us since you need the extra help. 

### Human: True but not liking your attitude, so either we walk from this or we can do it this way 2 foods 2 firewoods 1 water

### Assistant: Hmm you seem very absolute and I apologize if you perceive any attitude and I am for New York we are know for our sassiness. It does seem to be about what you need and not hearing the other side I will have to give you a firm no unless you are willing to rework some of you're numbers. Anything you are willing to budge on?
