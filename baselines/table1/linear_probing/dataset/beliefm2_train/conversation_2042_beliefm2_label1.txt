### Assistant: Hello fellow camper! ðŸ™‚ How are you today?

### Human: I'm doing okay! Kind of a slow day on MTurk, how are you?

### Assistant: I am doing quite well actually. What supplies do you need?

### Human: Firewood would be great! 

### Assistant: I agree that it would be great. I didn't bring an axe though. So it is hard for me to get anymore.

### Human: Ah I see, do you have food then?

### Assistant: I do have food. What exactly are you thinking?

### Human: Well, what is it that you're looking for?

### Assistant: I need extra firewood and a little food. Since I didn't bring my axe, as I mentioned earlier, it is hard for me to get extra wood. I would like some food because I have an extra guest.

### Human: Okay, since firewood is a higher value item than food, I could trade you 2 firewood for 3 food in return?

### Assistant: If you get all the food I would need all the water to barter with someone else.

### Human: How about one food and two water then, in exchange for 2 firewood.
