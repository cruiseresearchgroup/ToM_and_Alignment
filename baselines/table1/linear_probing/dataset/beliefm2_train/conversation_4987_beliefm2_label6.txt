### Assistant: Hello!

### Human: Hello

### Assistant: On my upcoming trip, I would like some extra food and water for my family.

### Human: Ok. I would like to have some extra firewood.

### Assistant: Do you have a preference between food and water?

### Human: I would like water more than food. 

### Assistant: How many wood do you think you need?

### Human: I would like 2 of the firewood. What do you think? 

### Assistant: I don't need wood as I am usually warm so I think we can work out a deal. I like to have more water and I usually get thirsty.

### Human: That sounds good to me. ðŸ™‚ I think we can make a good deal.

### Assistant: I can give you 3 wood packages if I can get 3 water and 2 food. So you will receive 3 wood and 1 food. What do you think?

### Human: I would like 2 wood, 1 water and 1 food. You would get 1 wood, 2 water and 2 food.

### Assistant: I don't need any wood. Do you have any alternatives?

### Human: Submit-Deal

### Assistant: Reject-Deal

### Assistant: I think my original offer is fair. I want you to have your most desired item (wood) and I get mine (water).

### Human: Ok. ðŸ™‚ 

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
