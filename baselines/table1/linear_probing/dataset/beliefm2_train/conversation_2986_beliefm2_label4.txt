### Assistant: I am also in need of water. It is so very hot! I'm not sure I can spare any. How many people are you camping with?

### Human: it will be just me and one other person, we don't need much, but i do want to make sure he is taken care of since he has asthma.

### Assistant: Understood. What about food? Do you feel like you are set in that area?

### Human: i have some food and i think it should last , but one can never bee to careful.

### Assistant: How about I get 2 waters, 1 firewood, and 2 food?

### Human: i can spare some food but I am really low on water. how about you take 2 food 2 firewood and 1 water and i take 2 water one food and 1 firewood?

### Assistant: Hmmm, not sure about the water. It's scorching hot. If we do any hiking we are really going to need it.
