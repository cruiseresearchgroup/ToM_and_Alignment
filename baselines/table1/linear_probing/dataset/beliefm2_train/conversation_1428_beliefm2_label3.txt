### Human: hello

### Assistant: Hey, how are you?

### Human: I am doing good. Thanks. Which item do you need the most?

### Assistant: I was thinking firewood, because the most fun I have camping is roasting marshmellows and hanging out around there. How about you?

### Human: Oh hmm. I really need extra firewood because I forgot to bring a sleeping bag. I will be freezing to death at night. ☹️

### Assistant: Okay, well tell me what you need the least of, if you don't mind.

### Human: You can have all of the water if you let me have all of the firewood.

### Assistant: hmm, here's what I'm willing to do. I will take all the water, one firewood and one food.

### Human: That doesn't sound fair to me.

### Assistant: Ok, what would you counter offer with?

### Human: I would like all 3 packages of firewood and 1 package of food. You can have the rest.

### Assistant: Well, I would like at least one firewood, it is the thing I most need.
