### Human: Hello, how are you today?

### Assistant: I am doing good. How about yourself?

### Human: I am great, i am really excited about going camping, how about you?

### Assistant: Yeah, I want to make sure i am prepared. What do you think are the bests options?

### Human: Well i would really like to have extra firewood since i am afraid of the dark and i don't need extra water so i was hoping you would want to trade that

### Assistant: Yes, I think that sounds like a good option. I personally could use more food. I like to eat. 

### Human: how do you propose we split the food then?

### Assistant: Well I don't mind either way about the food. I'll recommend giving you 2 firewood 1 food and 1 water. 

### Human: how about you get 3 waters and 2 foods? Does that work better?

### Assistant: yes how much firewood. I need at least 1 to cook the food.

### Human: you should have enough firewood in the basic supplies to cook the food i think, with three waters and 2 foods you get 5 items and i get 4
