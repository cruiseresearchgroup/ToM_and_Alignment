### Human: hi, I'm looking forward to going camping soon

### Assistant: Me too! Camping is so much fun

### Human: I will want to get some extra supplies before I go. 

### Assistant: Same. My family is coming with me so I want to make sure we are extra prepared

### Human: Me too. We invited a lot of extra friends

### Assistant: I am hoping we have enough food. I'm worried we might run out so I'd like to get some more 

### Human: I know we need extra food too and some firewood. Maybe a little water but we shouldn't need too much

### Assistant: It sounds like we are looking for the same things. I think there are some extra we can share. Do you have an idea about how it can be the most fair? 

### Human: how about I'll give you 2 food if you give me 2 firewood and 2 of the water?

### Assistant: I think that is a fair deal! 

### Human: great, let's do it

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
