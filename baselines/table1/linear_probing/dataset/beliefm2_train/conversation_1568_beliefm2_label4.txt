### Human: I would rather not say.  What is your main focus?

### Assistant: Well, I'm gonna be out in the desert, so ... I might need some extra water..., and food too, since I'm taking my sisters kids w/ me...

### Human: I will allow or the other, not both.

### Assistant: how about I get all the water, and 1 food, and 2 extra firewood as well?
