### Human: Hello, It's nice to meet you.

### Assistant: Hi there, it is nice to meet you too. 

### Human: I am worried I'm going to be cold at night, I'd like more firewood if possible.

### Assistant: I can understand that, but I would also like to have more firewood because I am anemic. I get cold very, very easily, even in the daytime. ☹️

### Human: What about food? I don't need a lot since I ate alot yesterday.

### Assistant: How would you feel about me taking 3 firewood and 2 water and you taking 1 water and 3 food?

### Human: I don't need that much food though. I'm more worried about having water since there's no streams around.

### Assistant: Okay, that is a good point. How about I take 3 firewood, 1 water, 1 food, and you take 2 water and 2 food?

### Human: I think I'll need at least 1 firewood. How about I get 1 firewood 2 water and 1 food? Leaving you 2 firewood 1 water and 2 food.

### Assistant: I like the sound of that. We will both get at least one of everything this way.

### Human: Yep! sounds great! We of each get something of everything.
