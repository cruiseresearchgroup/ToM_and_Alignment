### Assistant: Hi there, how are you?

### Human: I'm good how are you doing?

### Assistant: Great, hoping we can make a deal. I'm in need of more food, is there anything you need?

### Human: I could really use some more water ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Sounds good, I would be happy to trade you all the water for all the food. Would that work?

### Human: That would be good but how should we devide the firewood?

### Assistant: Hmmm.... let me think, it can't go 50/50 :-(

### Human: Lets see. I already have a bit of firewood so how about i take 3 water and 1 firewood. Then you can have 3 food and 2 firewood?

### Assistant: Are you sure? That's very generous! ðŸ™‚

### Human: Yea that way we both get what we need! 

### Assistant: Thank you so much! Let me submit a deal to you. 

### Human: Sounds great!
