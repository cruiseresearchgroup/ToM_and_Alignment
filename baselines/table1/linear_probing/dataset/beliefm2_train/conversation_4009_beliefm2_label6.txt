### Assistant: Hello Friend. I feel so excited about this camping trip. I've waiting for a long time to make this trip come true. How do you feel about it

### Human: Hello! I'm also very excited! Let's make sure each of us has enough supplies to make it a good trip.

### Assistant: Yeah. Sute

### Human: I would love to have as much water as possible. I get dehydrated very easily.

### Assistant: My kids will be hiking so I will need them to have enough water for the trip so they won't get thirsty. 

### Human: How about firewood? Do you plan on having many fires?

### Assistant: I really dont need the firewood. You can have all of them. As long as I have enough water and food to survive the camping trip

### Human: What if I take all the firewood and one water, you take 2 waters and all the food?

### Assistant: It would be nice. I get 2 water and 3 food. You get the 3 firewood and 1 food. 

### Human: Yes, that sounds like a plan!

### Assistant: Yeah. A great one. Let's make a deal then

### Human: Submit-Deal
