### Assistant: Hey, how are you doing today? are you excited to go camping?

### Human: I am good. How about you?  Yes, I love camping!

### Assistant: I am doing great! camping is super enjoyable

### Human: Do you bring enough stuff?

### Assistant: I have some stuff, but I really need a decent amount of firewood. Gets really cold at night where we camp

### Human: I am fine with the cold although I might need some to set up the fire. I have a baby with me so I might need to heat up the milk or food. 

### Assistant: Oh, I see. How about 2 firewood for you and 2 food. I keep the rest

### Human: I don't really need food. I can do it with 1 firewood so you can get the rest. But I really need water. We are going hiking and drink a lot.

### Assistant: Ok, would you do 1 firewood, 2 water and 1 food then?

### Human: Can I get 3 water and 1 firewood instead?

### Assistant: so I get 2 firewood, and 3 food? Ok I will agree to that

### Human: Great! Sounds like a deal! we have enough food for tonight so I think we will be good.
