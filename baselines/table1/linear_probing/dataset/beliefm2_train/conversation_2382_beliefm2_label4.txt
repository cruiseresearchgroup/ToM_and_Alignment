### Human: Hello there! I am in need of additional water due to my health condition

### Assistant: What kind of health condition?  We both require water to make it thru the camping trip

### Human: Due to my blood pressure medicaton, I need to stay hydrated at all times. It is more important for me to drink rather than eat which is why I would give you more food in exchange for more water for me

### Assistant: That is understandable but if you were to get the majority of the water I would want all the firewood and 2 packages of food 

### Human: I am happy to give you 2 packs of food and the lions share of the firewood but I think I need 1 firewood. I am not a good firestarter

### Assistant: So are you ok with me getting 1 package of water and 2 firewood and 2 food

### Human: I am absolutely OK with that deal.

### Assistant: Just need to make sure we are both have sufficient supplies because I dont know about you but living off the land would probably be disastrous for me

### Human: I appreciate your concern. I did bring a little bit of emergency food

### Assistant: I think we have struck a deal then.  Unless there is anything else to be discussed I think we can conclude the negotiation 

### Human: I agree

### Assistant: Thanks for the quick negotiation and I am going to submit the deal on my side
