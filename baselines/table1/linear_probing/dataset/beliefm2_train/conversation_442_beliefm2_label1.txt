### Assistant: Hello ðŸ™‚ For my trip, we will need 3 firewood to burn a large bonfire. Would you like to give us all your supplies and join our party?

### Human: As long as I would be able to join your party, that sounds like a great deal. We can all be warm.

### Assistant: Yes! ðŸ™‚ You are welcome here. All of your friends are also welcome here. ðŸ™‚ We will all be warm together.

### Human: You can have all three wood.

### Assistant: Thank you. We may also have all three food the merrier?

### Human: I don't think that is fair. I will take two of the food, and we can always share or trade later. 

### Assistant: I am somewhat bewildered by your sudden move. ðŸ˜® Aren't you joining our party?

### Human: Yes, but I would like to keep some of the food on my person in case something happens.

### Assistant: I hope there's some way that you and I could see eye to eye without conflict. Would you like to bring someone arbitrary to quartermaster our food?

### Human: if you have three wood already, i need some of the extra supplies.

### Assistant: Would you like to hold all three water, while I hold all 3 firewood and an arbitrary cook in our party holds 3 food?? 

### Human: I can agree to that deal
