### Human: Hi I need 2 packages of  food and water and 1 of wood

### Assistant: Hey, I could really use the extra water package, is there a specific reason you need extra food and water?

### Human: I have kids with me that's the reason I need extra water and its summer

### Assistant: I can give you all three waters if I can have 2 foods & all 3 firewood.

### Human: It will be really hard to survive if I give you all 3 waters since all the packages are essential. ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Do you have another deal you'd be willing to make?

### Human: It would be really hard for me  . please consider my deal 

### Assistant: Would you take 2 waters, 1 food and 2 firewood?

### Human: My preference is 2 waters, 2 food and 1 fire wood

### Assistant: I'm sorry but I just won't be able to do that. 

### Human: as you know it won't be beneficial if we break the deal

### Assistant: I understand, as well as you do I'm sure.
