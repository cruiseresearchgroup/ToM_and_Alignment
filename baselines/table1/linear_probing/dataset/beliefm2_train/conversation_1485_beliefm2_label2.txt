### Assistant: Hi, have you camped here beforeðŸ™‚

### Human: No I have not, but I go camping frequently.

### Assistant: It's a great camp ground, did you bring every thing you need??

### Human: I have the basic supplies needed, but there are definitely some things I could use more of.

### Assistant: We are in the same boat. We have lots of water but sure could use some more food

### Human: Yes, I definitely need some more food since I have several small children to feed.

### Assistant: This is going to be tough if we both need food. I can trade you water for anything you don't need

### Human: I need the firewood the most, it is supposed to be very cold and I don't want the little ones to get frostbite or anything.

### Assistant: I can give you 3 firewoods for 3 foods

### Human: I can only spare 2 food. Is that okay?

### Assistant: I can do 3 firewoods for 3 foods and i'll even be nice and give you 2 waters and i'll only take 1

### Human: Ok thank you very much!ðŸ™‚
