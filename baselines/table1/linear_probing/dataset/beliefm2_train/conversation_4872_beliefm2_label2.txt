### Assistant: I feel like I can make due without a lot of extra water, but I'm a little concerned about my ability to get food in an emergency.

### Human: I brought a pretty good amount of food due to my diabetes so I'm good in that area. I only need a little extra.

### Assistant: What are you most desirous of? ðŸ™‚

### Human: I have enough food to make sure I counteract low blood sugar but water is essential to me because I get dehydrated a lot, and I didn't bring enough water.

### Assistant: I feel like firewood is helpful with everything.  Keeps you warm, can cook food, and can be used to sterilize water as well.

### Human: True I feel the same. The thing is I'm anemic and get cold easily so I'd prefer 2 of the firewoods.

### Assistant: I think if I were going to give up 2 of the firewoods I'd want to get all three of the food.

### Human: I don't know if I can give you all the extra food. I can negotiate and let you have two of the firewoods. because I did bring an extra blanket.

### Assistant: Well, food is definitely my biggest concern.  How much of the water did you want?  That's the least of my concerns because I feel like water can be found most readily.

### Human: I would like two of the waters because I can only drink purified water. So firewood is your next biggest concern?

### Assistant: No, food is my bigger concern.  If your biggest concern is water, what about me getting all the food and you getting all the water?

### Human: Food isn't my biggest concern but it is still a concern. I suffer from low blood sugar so it's essential for me to eat a certain amount of healthy foods. i can give you 2 of the food packages but I'd like to keep one for myself. I'd like two of the waters and only one of the firewoods. :-)

### Assistant: That sounds reasonable.  That gives each of us some of everything, which I think makes sense.   Why don't you propose that and I'll agree to it.

### Human: Great you have a deal. I'm happy we were able to come to a compromise. :-D
