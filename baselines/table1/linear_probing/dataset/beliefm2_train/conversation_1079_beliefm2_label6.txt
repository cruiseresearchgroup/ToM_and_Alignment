### Assistant: Who is willing to cooperate in a consensual offer so that we can all get fruitful dividendsðŸ˜¡

### Human: ðŸ˜® What is your offer then? 

### Assistant: 2 of water, plus 2 of food and 0 of firewood

### Human: That doesn't seem totally fair. How about I take 2 water instead? 

### Assistant: I would give you 2 water in exchange for 3 food and 1 firewood

### Human: Hm. Getting warmer. What do you need the most of? 

### Assistant: I need more water than the other options, you can keep 2 food and 2 firewood but 1 water

### Human: I also feel that water is the most important. How about I take all 3 water, and you can take 2 firewood, and 2 foods?

### Assistant: I think the fairest thing would be that you keep 1 water, 2 food, 2 firewood

### Human: How about I take 2 water, 2 firewood, and 2 food, and then you take the rest

### Assistant: Let's stay like this, 2 of water, 1 of food, 1 of firewood and you take the rest

### Human: I really need the water more than the rest of that stuff. I'll take 2 waters, 1 food, and 1 firewood. 

### Assistant: We close the deal if I drink 1 water, 2 meals, and 3 firewood

### Human: Give me just 1 firewood, and we'll have a deal
