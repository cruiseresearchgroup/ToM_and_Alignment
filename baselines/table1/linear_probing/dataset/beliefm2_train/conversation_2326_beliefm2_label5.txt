### Human: I am so pumped up about this camping trip.  Considering my party and our plans, we are going to need a lot of food and firewood!

### Assistant: Hey there. I am going camping as well. I am excited but also worried. I want to make sure I have enough supplies..ðŸ˜®

### Human: I hear you!  How many people are in your party?

### Assistant: I have maximum permitted people per camping spot = 5 ðŸ™‚ Do you have less or also maximum permitted?

### Human: We have 8 in our party.  While we have big plans, unfortunately, we have one member of the party that is severely allergic to lots of food.

### Assistant: I get the whole food thing - this is what worries me the most - food. Because I myself suffer from condition to where I have to eat or snack multiple times a day and sometimes even night! I need to make sure I have enough food. But that is terrible for one member of yours because that means he/she might not even be able to eat the food provided?? ðŸ˜®

### Human: It's going to be a real challenge for sure.  It sounds like food is high on our lists.  I may have a little wiggle room, but that means getting all the firewood as he is ok with most fish.  Means a little more work though!  ðŸ˜®

### Assistant: The whole entire firewoodðŸ˜®. I think it depends where we stand on water? How much wiggle room on food?

### Human: Fortunately, we have an excellent source of fresh water near our camping site!  I would be happy to give you all of the water, while I take all of the firewood.  As for the food, how about I take 2 and you take 1?

### Assistant: Food is the most of my worry.. As I said - I constantly need to eat.. Wouldn't you party member, who is allergic, bring additional food since food provided is limited type? I would like to have 2 foods, please? Otherwise I can live with the rest of the deal even though I get cold very easy and would be sacrificing comfort if I give all firewood? But I would be willing if you give me all the food. My boyfriend is coming with me and he will need to keep me warmðŸ™‚

### Human: You are definitely testing me a bit here.  Food is also so very crucial.  I would be willing to make that exchange for one water just in case we change sites.  So, I get 3 firewood, 1 water, and 1 food?  

### Assistant: I was thinking for me either 2 food and 3 water and no firewood or 3 food and 2 water and no firewood or other wise I would take 2 food, 2 water and 1 firewood?
