### Assistant: Hi, how are you?

### Human: Hi! I am great!

### Assistant: I'd like to get 3 of the firewood and 2 food

### Human: Okay. I would like three firewood too. We need to negotiate. Maybe one of us can have one and the other person can have the other

### Assistant: I think I'm really going to be stuck on the 3 firewood. I don't know if I can budge there. What about the food and water?

### Human: Okay. If you want the three firewood, I can take all the food and water. Would that work?

### Assistant: I can let you have all the water. How about either 3 firewood and 1 food for me or 2 firewood and 2 food for me?

### Human: 2 firewoods and 2 foods is okay

### Assistant: ok, I'll send that as the deal

### Human: okay so I will take 1 firewood 1 food and three waters

### Assistant: Yes

### Human: sounds like a plan
