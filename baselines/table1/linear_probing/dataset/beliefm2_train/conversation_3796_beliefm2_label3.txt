### Assistant: Hi, im pretty excited about camping, what about you?

### Human: Yea I am too.

### Assistant: i am camping in a pretty damp jungle area, so i would like 3 firewoods please, and maybe 1 of either food or water, your choice

### Human: I think we should split the gear evenly so everyone can be happy.

### Assistant: Well if i take 3 firewood, and one of something else, i only get 4 items, you get 5. i think that is fair

### Human: Yes but you are rushing it too quick my friend.

### Assistant: I see what you mean.ðŸ™‚

### Human: What are your most important items?

### Assistant: Firewood, what about you?

### Human: Me too unfortunately

### Assistant: well in that case, you can have all the fire wood, if i can have all the water and 2 foods, that way you get all three of your most important item

### Human: Submit-Deal
