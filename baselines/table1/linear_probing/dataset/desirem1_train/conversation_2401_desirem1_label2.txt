### Assistant: Hi, how are you?

### Human: Hi, I'm good! Looking to get a bunch of food and firewood for this trip ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Nice! I'll give you all the food if I can have the firewood and water

### Human: I can part with the water, but I'd at least like some extra firewood to cook my food

### Assistant: OK, how about we split each of them? I'm thinking you could get 2 food, 1 firewood and 1 water

### Human: I'd rather get the entirety of the food and 2 firewood if possible.

### Assistant: I can't do that unfortunately. Seems like we both have those 2 as our top priorities! I can give you all the food but I'd need all the firewood and 2 waters

### Human: Which do you need more, firewood or water?

### Assistant: Firewood

### Human: Okay, so you will get 3 firewood 2 water. I will get 3 food 1 water. is that fine?

### Assistant: yep that works!

### Human: Submit-Deal
