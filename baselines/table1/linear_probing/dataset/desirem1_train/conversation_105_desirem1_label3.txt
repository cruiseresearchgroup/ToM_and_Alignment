### Human: Hi! I am good at gathering/ catching food, so if i get the firewood, it will help me to cook what I catch

### Assistant: I see.  I in particular require lots of water for subsistence.

### Human: hm. well, I also want some water to cook with. food i don't really need.

### Assistant: I want a rolls royce.  That doesn't mean I should get a Rolls Royce and a BMW.

### Human: haha, that's true. but still, I'm wondering, if i give you all the food and two waters, would you let me have one water?

### Assistant: That seems like a decent starting point, I would be willing to share one water because I am not a monster. ðŸ™‚

### Human: Ah! thank you, yes! ðŸ™‚ out of curiousity is the food of any value to you?

### Assistant: A little bit, but I would be willing to give you all the firewood, I can keep warm enough.

### Human: Ok, perfect! so it sounds like we have a deal, huh?

### Assistant: So you get 1 water, 0 food and 3 firewood?

### Human: Yes! thats it!ðŸ™‚ Sounds good to me.

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
