### Human: Hi, I'd like to trade 3 firewood for 3 waters

### Assistant: Hmm, I really need at least some water. I forgot to being extra for my dog T_T 

### Human: me as well.. that's okay. what do you suggest?

### Assistant: Well, I'm on a diet, so extra food would just be a temptation, lol. You can have the food, if I can have a water?

### Human: my son is diabetic so he has to have some food on hand. how much do you suggest?

### Assistant: No problem. It seems like you really want food right? So you can have it all. 

### Human: Would it be a fair trade for 1 water and 2 firewood?

### Assistant: well, I really want at least 4 packages - for weight if nothing else. Working on losing weight remember ðŸ™‚

### Human: Oh that's smart I can't even lie haha. Okay 1 water 3 firewood for 3 food sound good?

### Assistant: Yeah, I think I could do that. It gets me a decent amount of what I need. Does it get you what you need?

### Human: Yes, perfect.

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
