### Assistant: Hi. What do you expect from me?

### Human: Hello. I am hoping to take 3 of the firewood, since I have a small baby and need to heat their milk.

### Assistant: I would like to share 2 firewood with you. Because my place is so cold. I want at least 1 firewood for me. 

### Human: OK. Wouldn't want you to be cold, you can take 1 of the woods. üôÇ  What about the food?

### Assistant: I would share 1 food for you. Because my child and my wife want to food.

### Human: Sounds good to me, I'll take the 1 food.  How are you for water?

### Assistant: I like to share with you 1 water. Because I live only drink water.

### Human: Would I be able to take 2 of the waters? The water I packed for the trip was stolen as I was loading the car. I can give you all 3 of the food since my mother inlaw gave us enough food to last us a month. üôÇ

### Assistant: Water is important for me. Because I have kidney problems and I drink less water, they affect my health.

### Human: ‚òπÔ∏èThat's a shame. I'll give you 2 water.  So do we have a deal with you getting 1 firewood, 2 waters and 2 food?

### Assistant: I will give you 1 water, 2 firewood and 1 food.

### Human: Not the best deal for me but I'll take it.
