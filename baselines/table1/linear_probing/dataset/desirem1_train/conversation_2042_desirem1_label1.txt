### Human: Hello fellow camper! ðŸ™‚ How are you today?

### Assistant: I'm doing okay! Kind of a slow day on MTurk, how are you?

### Human: I am doing quite well actually. What supplies do you need?

### Assistant: Firewood would be great! 

### Human: I agree that it would be great. I didn't bring an axe though. So it is hard for me to get anymore.

### Assistant: Ah I see, do you have food then?

### Human: I do have food. What exactly are you thinking?

### Assistant: Well, what is it that you're looking for?

### Human: I need extra firewood and a little food. Since I didn't bring my axe, as I mentioned earlier, it is hard for me to get extra wood. I would like some food because I have an extra guest.

### Assistant: Okay, since firewood is a higher value item than food, I could trade you 2 firewood for 3 food in return?

### Human: If you get all the food I would need all the water to barter with someone else.

### Assistant: How about one food and two water then, in exchange for 2 firewood.
