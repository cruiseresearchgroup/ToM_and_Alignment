### Human: Hi, how are you, ready for the big camping trip?

### Assistant: Yes I am. I'm actually already at the camp and came across some homeless people who could really use all the food they can get.

### Human: Wow, ok. I'd can give you some food, I'd like to have a little extra food and water as we have a larger group going. 

### Assistant: I see. Which is more important to you, food or water?

### Human: If I had my choice, I'd say I'd rather have more food.

### Assistant: Interesting. Looks like we are in the same situation! ðŸ˜®

### Human: I'd be willing to give you extra food if I could then get extra water and firewood. How about you Get 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood?

### Assistant: That sounds almost fair. But I could possibly use 1 more firewood. What do you think?ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚

### Human: Idk, you're already getting the extra food which would be important to me. I think my offer is very fair for both of us.

### Assistant: I'm not sure either. Well them, how about we switch and you can have 2 food, 1 water, and 1 firewood and I will take the rest. The homeless could use water almost as much as food

### Human: sure, i can agree to that
