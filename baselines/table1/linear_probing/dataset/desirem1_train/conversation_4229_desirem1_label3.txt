### Assistant: Hi, I think I should take two firewood, one food, and one water. 

### Human: Hi, I hope we can work together to find an offer that benefits both of us. Do you agree?ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: I agree!

### Human: Ok, could you tell me which item is the most valuable to you?

### Assistant: The firewood is most valuable to me because I get very cold at nighttime. Which is most valuable to you?

### Human: My most valuable item is Firewood too since my knee is injured and I won't be able to pick it up at camp. And the least valuable?

### Assistant: Water is least valuable to be because I can find my own water while camping. How about you?

### Human: My least valuable item is food because I'm thinðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Ok, I will need at least 1 firewood

### Human: What do you think of this offer: I give you 2 firewood and 1 food and what is left for me.

### Assistant: I would need 1 water just in case I can't find any drinking water

### Human: Remember that we already have the basic supplements for the camp, these are only extra items. And you have 2 of the most valuable, water is nothing for you.
