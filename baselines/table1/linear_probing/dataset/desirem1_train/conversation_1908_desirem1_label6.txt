### Human: hi how are you

### Assistant: I am well, thank you.  Yourself?

### Human: good here, I will need 3 water as I need it to survive

### Assistant: I need water as well.  I require it for subsistence

### Human: how many water you need?

### Assistant: In a perfect world, all the water ðŸ™‚

### Human: that won't be fair, how about I get 1 water, 3 food and 1 firewood, that way u get the most water

### Assistant: Interesting.  If I decided to forgo water completely, would you accept giving me everything else?

### Human: no, at the most i can do is i get 2 water, 2 food and 0 firewood or I get 1 water, 3 food and 1 firewood

### Assistant: But you get everything you wanted. You said you needed 3 water, I offered it to you.

### Human: but i can't give you 3 food and 3 firewood, thats 6 items vs the 3 water

### Assistant: Sure you can.  If you really want water the most, why would you care about the rest as much?ðŸ˜®

### Human: most does not mean i have to neglect the rest, anyways either a) I get 3 water, 2 food and 0 firewood or b) I get 1 water, 2 food and 2 firewood

### Assistant: That is simply unacceptable.
