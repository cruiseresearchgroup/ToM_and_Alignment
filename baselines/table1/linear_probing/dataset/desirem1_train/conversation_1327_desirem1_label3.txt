### Human: Hi . How is your camping trip going?

### Assistant: The trip is great, how about you?

### Human: It is great too. However i am feeling very cold i need a lot of firewood to light a fire.

### Assistant: We have -10 degrees temperatures at night where I am camping!!

### Human: It is even worse here and I am not feeling well

### Assistant: I am just going to walk away from the deal,  my family can't freeze

### Human: You can take 1 firewood then

### Assistant: C-ya, thanks anyways

### Human: I am glad you accepted. I really need it.

### Assistant: I will take all the food and water then

### Human: That will be very unfair of you. How am i going to survive without water or food?

### Assistant: You have food and water, this is just extra supplies

### Human: I know but with my condition i may not make it, especially without more water.ðŸ˜®

### Assistant: you can make water by boiling water with all that extra firewood you got

### Human: Submit-Deal

### Assistant: Reject-Deal

### Assistant: you said I could have some firewood

### Human: Submit-Deal

### Assistant: Reject-Deal

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
