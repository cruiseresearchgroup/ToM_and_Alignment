### Human: This is my fun trip for this year and preparing will help me be more self sufficient in the future.

### Assistant: Oh, how nice for you!

### Human: I would like to invite some friends you know to participate in the camping.

### Assistant: How many are you thinking about?

### Human: I was thinking 3 people this time around.

### Assistant: You're going to need lots of supplies then

### Human: They would be happy with the experience and I can be more altruistic this way.

### Assistant: I think maybe your biggest need will be water.

### Human: Yes, I agree that water would be the number one priority and it would help to be able to offer everyone a refreshing drink before letting them know how long the hike is.

### Assistant: So, I sugget you take the 3 pack of water and I will take the 3 pack of food and the 3 pack of firewood.

### Human: let me think about that for a second

### Assistant: That's pretty generous of me I think!
