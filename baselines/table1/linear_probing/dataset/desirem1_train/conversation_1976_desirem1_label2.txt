### Assistant: Hello How you doing?

### Human: Great! So since water is so heavy and the least desirable but needed, I will take most of the water and the wood. you can have the food and less of the other stuff. 

### Assistant: Okay I'll take food need much more and you?

### Human: I will take the water and the wood. I do think the wood is important too. Keep us warm, we can cook and boil water. SInce we are taking more food more firewood is a must tooðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Yeah Thank you very much both we take wood to share.

### Human: do you think we need some extra water too. Water is life ðŸ™‚ so I definitely think that's a must as well. I will carry all of the extra water to sweeten the deal

### Human: I will take 1 food 2 firewood and 3 waters, you take 2 food, 1 fire wood and 0 water. Deal?

### Assistant: Deal with ok but I need 1 water.

### Human: Right I should have said 1 for you. Not sure why I typed 3 for me.
