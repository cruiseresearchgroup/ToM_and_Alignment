### Assistant: Hello. I really just need firewood for my wife and daughter and some extra water for myself.

### Human: Hello, i also need firewood, i have a medical condition where it is very hard to maintain my body temperature. 

### Assistant: My wife is in the same boat. That sucks. I wonder if it will be cold.

### Human: Well i do not need the water at all as i have a distiller

### Assistant: And I have plenty of food as I'm the only over eater of the group.

### Human: OK how about 2 firewoods me 2 foods me 1 firewood you 1 food 3 water

### Assistant: If I'm only getting 1 firewood let me have 1 extra food then. So you can have the 2 firewoods, plus 1 food. I'll get 1 firewood, 2 foods and 3 waters. You get the most important item so I'm thinking that's fair.

### Human: No in the end i will only be getting 3 items where you get 6 i think my way is more fair

### Assistant: Yeah but my 6 aren't worth all that much. I'm the one who will have to answer to my family for not getting enough firewood. ðŸ™‚

### Human: Well then if the firewood is that importants you can have 2 but i need 2 food and 2 water then

### Assistant: That sounds good. Let's go with that.
