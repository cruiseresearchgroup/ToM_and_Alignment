### Assistant: nice, bro me also busy with packing, wish u most enjoyable trip bro

### Human: Thank you. You as well. Do you have enough of everything you need for your trip?

### Assistant: no bro, lets talk about the deal, bro dont end the negotiation it will lost both of us 

### Human: I understand. So what do you need the most? I really, really need firewood. I'm already almost out, and it's supposed to get very cold ‚òπÔ∏è

### Assistant: bro my first priority also firewood, what is ur second priority bro, me too need firewood 

### Human: My second priority is water.

### Assistant: then how can we fix the deal bro me too need firewood üòÆ

### Human: How about I'll take 2 firewoods, but give you 2 waters?

### Assistant: bropls give me 2 firewood u can take 2 water bro, i need fire wood more bro

### Human: I can't. I've got to have firewood. How about if you give me the 2 firewoods, I will only take 1 of everything else?

### Assistant: bro if you take 2 fire wood then  i need 1 firewood 3 water 2 food bro, then only it will balanced

### Human: That would leave me with no water? That doesn't seem very balanced. 

### Assistant: bro firewood is first priority mean you got firewood more then it is more benificial to you üò°

### Human: Yea, but that's why I only want 1 of everything else. That leaves you 2 of everything except the firewood. That sounds pretty fair to me.

### Assistant: if you need all, then make firewood 1 to you then it will balance, if u take one water from me its not equalize,

### Human: You would be getting 5 items, and I'm only getting 4. That's pretty balanced. 

### Assistant: then can we go for wiseversa? i will take 2 firewood, 1 water, 1 food is it ok? then will get 6 items 

### Human: I'll do the vise-versa. 

### Assistant: then tell me you deal vise wersa means? send me your deal
