### Assistant: hi, I'm looking forward to going camping soon

### Human: Me too! Camping is so much fun

### Assistant: I will want to get some extra supplies before I go. 

### Human: Same. My family is coming with me so I want to make sure we are extra prepared

### Assistant: Me too. We invited a lot of extra friends

### Human: I am hoping we have enough food. I'm worried we might run out so I'd like to get some more 

### Assistant: I know we need extra food too and some firewood. Maybe a little water but we shouldn't need too much

### Human: It sounds like we are looking for the same things. I think there are some extra we can share. Do you have an idea about how it can be the most fair? 

### Assistant: how about I'll give you 2 food if you give me 2 firewood and 2 of the water?

### Human: I think that is a fair deal! 

### Assistant: great, let's do it

### Human: Submit-Deal
