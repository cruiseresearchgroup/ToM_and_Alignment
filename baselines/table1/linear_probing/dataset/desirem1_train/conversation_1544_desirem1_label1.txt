### Human: Hello, I am so excited to get away from home and into the great outdoors for a few days!

### Assistant: Me too! I've been cooped up for too long.

### Human: Will be nice to set up a site and roast marshmallows over the camp fire.

### Assistant: That'll be fun, I just want to relax in the heat.

### Human: I'm planning to swim in a nearby lake to cool off, then maybe do some fishing and cook the up what we catch on the campfire.

### Assistant: I'm looking forward to grilling up some burgers and hot dogs.

### Human: Nice, so we will both be pretty hungry, we should split the extra food they are giving us.

### Assistant: OK, you can get 2 packages and I'll get 1?

### Human: Sounds great to me.  I'll need some extra firewood for all the campfire activities, so I'd like all of the wood.  You can have the water to keep hydrated.

### Assistant: Sounds good to me.

### Human: Excellent!  Thanks for your negotiation, and enjoy your trip : )

### Assistant: You too.
