### Assistant: What do you have in mind?

### Human: I need additional packages of water, given that I get dehydrated fast.

### Assistant: I understand I have that issue as well. I will likly die on one  package . If i get two i will share it with you we can ration it 

### Human: This is something we will have to work on, how about we can share 2-1?

### Assistant: I will need 2 and give you one. I am willing to pass on the fire wood meaning. I get 2 packages of water and you get access to it an emergency.

### Human: In that case, I will need more of food.

### Assistant: that could work 2-1 for food; fire wood could be shared I know how to store it incase of rain and am a skilled out doors man. 

### Human: What are your thoughts on how to share firewood?

### Assistant: I am a skilled outdoorsmen If you let me hold all the firewood I would be able to perserve it. 

### Human: Appreciate it. But, it's not advisable to rely on skills, we never know what situation can we expect?

### Assistant: Thats true--But I am concerned about you if something happens to me you may not be able to utlise it. Maybe you could but I think we would both benfit if I held all the fire wood that way I could teach you some tricks.

### Human: That is so nice of you to be concerned of me. But, yes, I need to think of the food as well and would need firewood.

### Assistant: Yeah I agree that you could hold the food 2-1 that way there is a system of checks and balances.

### Human: Hmm..this is between thinking of the present and future. My reasoning is concerning the present.
