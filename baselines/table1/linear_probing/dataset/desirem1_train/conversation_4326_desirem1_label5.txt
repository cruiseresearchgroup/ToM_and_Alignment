### Assistant: Hi'

### Human: Hello I would like to take 3 extra food packages and 3 extra water package and 1 extra firewood packages because we had some unexpected guest join us on our camping trip.ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: I need 3 food packages as it is required to feed children who visited unexpectedly. Instead you can take water and firewood

### Human: No that doesn't work for me. I also have children with me. 4 children in total.  how about i take 2 food packages and 2 water packages and you take 1 food 1 water and 3 firewood packages.

### Assistant: I too have the same issue. I am also asking for children only , better you could accept 1 food , 2 water and 3 firewood, I hope this deal will work out for you

### Human: I need at least 2 food packages and at least 1 water. I can live with out any extra firewood.

### Assistant: Please do understand my situation its very very critical to give 2 food packages to you.Instead you can take 3 waters and firewood too.

### Human: No that will not work for me given that I have 4 growing children of different ages who eat like adults. I need at least 2 food packages and 1 water. That gives you 1 food package and 2 waters and 3 firewoods.

### Assistant: I too have children who eat like adults they too can't able to withstand hunger so you please show some mercy and give me 3 food packages and take all water and firewood

### Human: No I need extra food too. I cannot let my children starve and you cant let your children go thirsty. So if you cant agree to share the food i will walk away from the deal.

### Assistant: There is no point in walk away. This deal should be done mutually and beneficial for both. So its better I will take 2 food packages, you can take 1 food package, 2 water and 3 fire wood .Hope this will definitely work for you.

### Human: No i absolutely need 2 food packages and 1 water. How about we do it like this... You take 1 food package, 2 waters and 2 firewoods. Does that work for you?
