### Human: Ok, let me then give you 2 packages of firewood and 2 packages of water and you give me 2 packages of food. What about that?

### Assistant: So I get 1 food, 2 water and 2 firewood?

### Human: What is your take?

### Assistant: And you will get 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood? I think it is a great deal since food is hard to find in the camp site. I don't think you want to go huntingðŸ™‚
