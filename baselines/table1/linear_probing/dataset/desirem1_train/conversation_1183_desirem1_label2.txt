### Human: I was wondering if maybe i could get 2 food packages 1 firewood and 3 waters? pretty please?

### Assistant: I really need 2 food packages because we have a lot of people to feed. I could give you 2 water if you give me the 2 foo packages. How does that sound?

### Human: ðŸ˜®oh no! i left my cooler of food at home so we dont have any food at all. i dont have any use for water unfortunately 

### Assistant: oh wow okay okay i can give you 2 food packages and i can get 1. 

### Human: ðŸ™‚ thank you so much! that is very helpful to me. thanks for being compassionate. so what sounds fair with regards to firewood and water?

### Assistant: okay could i have 2 waters since we will be using more than i thought with the amount of people. So i get 2 and you get one does that sound good for the water?

### Human: i am willing to give you all three waters if you would like 3 instead of 2 because there is a stream next to our campsite and i could get water there. would you take all 3 instead of 2 waters?

### Assistant: okay that would be great thank you so much. and the wood what do you think?

### Human: i would like to have at last 2 of the firewood as i have a broken ankle and am unable to gather firewood myself. i am camping with small children and i dont expect for them to be much help with gathering wood

### Assistant: okay, i can do that i will give you 2 

### Human: actually can we revisit the water. could i get 1 water and you can have 2

### Assistant: okay that fine i can do that with that water, Thats no problem

### Human: thank you!ðŸ™‚ so i get 2 food 2 firewood and 1 water? thats awesome thank you? we have a deal?

### Assistant: yes that correct! it s a deal
