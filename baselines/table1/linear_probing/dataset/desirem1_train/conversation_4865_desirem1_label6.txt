### Assistant: Hello there!  Are you excited for your upcoming trip?! ðŸ™‚ I am very excited getting my things packed and lined up for the week long trip myself! What items are you needing the most of?

### Human: Hey, Back this trip should be a blast. I hope to not have as many misqueots around this time. Well I could use some extra water and fire wood.I dont eat much when camping because of a digestive issue and lack of easy bathrooms

### Assistant: I could definitely spare some extra water as it has been very rainy and wet in the area I will be going to! I am not so sure how much firewood I can spare due to it being so wet in the area! If I give up all the water, could I get 2 of the firewood, leaving you with 1?

### Human: That seems fair if you are going to the extra wet area, and finding dry kendling can be hard if its been raining or is extra humid. How are you on food in that area

### Assistant: The food situation has me a little nervous.  I've been worried about how many small animals will be in the area due to the rising waters.  I hope some stuck around, but I will see when I get there.  I also read how a terrible disease is killing some of the vegetation in spots around where I will be going.  It is some sort of fungus that is coming up due to it being so wet.

### Human: eww, That is a very wet area. My area flooded last year and the laike go so high it flooded camping spots.even the fish were hard to find, mostly because they were so well fed with the bugs washing in the water. Food could be a issue for you

### Assistant: Yes it might be.  Although I would really love to really test my survivor skills, I would like to err on the side of caution and take 2 if I you are alright with that.  I would be willing to give up all the water to make it most fair. ðŸ™‚

### Human: I wouldent want you to push the survival test that far with the water. even with a filter bottle or straw the lake water still has a lake taist and if it gets hot and the algie blooms you cant drink the water, its unsafe. I could go with two waters and one wood and one food and be okay

### Assistant: If I have the extra firewood I feel comfortable with boiling it to be safe to consume. 

### Human: That would be a good way to make sure it is safer. would you want all 3 wood then?

### Assistant: Yes if I can then! I will let you have all 3 of the waters in exchange!

### Human: I couldent take all the water and not feel guilty about it. Water is one of the most important things for survival
