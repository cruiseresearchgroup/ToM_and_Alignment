### Human: Hey! I would love to be able to acquire some food packages. It would help me so vey much.ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Hi, yes! I can help you out with that, I'm bringing a bunch of food on my trip.

### Human: That's awesome, I'm so glad to hear it! Thanks for understanding. 

### Assistant: Of course! The only thing I really need is water, I'm camping deep in the woods and there's no lake or water source around me, so I need to keep as much water as possible.

### Human: Oh definitely, that is so important. That sounds like a really great trip. Glad you'll be able to get off the grid a little bit.

### Assistant: Me too. It's definitely needed after everything this year.

### Human: Seriously! 2020 is the year to escape reality if there has ever been a need before. Haha.

### Assistant: haha for sure. are you excited for your trip?

### Human: I think so - kids don't do great outdoors for extended amounts of times because of bugs so that stinks. LOL But have enough firewood will help with that too!

### Assistant: Definitely! Ok so if I give you all my food, can I keep all my water and we can split the firewood however you'd like

### Human: That sounds like a great plan!
