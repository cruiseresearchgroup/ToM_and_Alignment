### Assistant: Hi there, I hope I would be able to leave with some needed items

### Human: Likewise! What are you in need of

### Assistant: The basics of man -  food and water

### Human: Ah, okay, I could use some of that too! Which one do you need most?

### Assistant: water. How about you?

### Human: I could use water, too, but I'd be willing to give some up if you give me more items overall

### Assistant: What is your priority item to get the division started?

### Human: I would propose that I get 1 water, 1 food and 3 firewood and you would get 2 water and 2 food

### Assistant: I don't mind the division but I would like a pack of firewood added because my family of 7 consume this item as well during the day & night

### Human: you would have to give more items up to get firewood. if you get more water, which is our highest item, i need more of other items

### Assistant: How about 1 water, 2 food and 2 firewood?

### Human: I don't really need food, to be honest. Food is the least of my worries.
