### Assistant: What supplies would you like?

### Human: Hi there, how are you?

### Assistant: I am fine thanks. 

### Human: Cool. This is going to be my kid's first camping trip so they're looking forward to building a campfire, making s'mores and telling ghost stories. I'd like to keep 3 firewood if possible. Are there supplies that you would like?

### Assistant: I would like some firewood too as I get cold easily. You can keep all of the food for your children if you will give me at least 1 firewood and all of the water

### Human: That sounds fair. So the deal will be 2 firewood and 3 food for me and 1 firewood and 3 water for you?

### Assistant: Yes. Maybe we should negotiate more. 

### Human: No worries. I completely understand.

### Assistant: What would be your ideal preference?\

### Human: 3 firewood would have been optimal but I see your point about being cold and don't want to be that insensitive. So I am good with the 2 firewood.

### Assistant: Okay I think that is fair. 

### Human: Submit-Deal
