### Assistant: hello, looking forward to campingðŸ™‚

### Human: I am very excited too I have never been camping!

### Assistant: wow, I thought everyone has camped onceðŸ˜®

### Human: Not me!  I don't really love the outdoors too much ðŸ˜®

### Assistant: oh, okay, well will be hiking and could use all 3 waters

### Human: Well I know that I can go without water for a little, but knowing how hot the weather is supposed to be this week I could really use the water, as well.  I would be okay with me taking a water and you taking two since you will be doing physical exercise.

### Assistant: great, you can have all the food and i'll take all the firewood?

### Human: Or, we could split those as well.  I was thinking about splitting the firewood two to one so that I could definitely stay warm.  I would want to stay up around the fire probably all night so I would much prefer having more of that.

### Assistant: i would prefer 2 firewood and 1 food. we will be catching fish to eat

### Human: Well the firewood is how we are going to make our food.

### Assistant: ok, so I'll take 2 water, 1 firewood, and 2 food?

### Human: Sounds good to me!  I am very happy we cam to an agreement
