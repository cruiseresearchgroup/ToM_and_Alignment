### Assistant: I am.  I assume you are as well.

### Human: This is true. ðŸ™‚.  I'm heading out to Kofa National Wildlife resort in AZ, you?

### Assistant: I would rather not say.  What is your main focus?

### Human: Well, I'm gonna be out in the desert, so ... I might need some extra water..., and food too, since I'm taking my sisters kids w/ me...

### Assistant: I will allow or the other, not both.

### Human: how about I get all the water, and 1 food, and 2 extra firewood as well?

### Assistant: How about no.  You can have all the water, I get 2 food and 3 firewood.

### Human: I need at least 1 firewood, 3 water, and 1 food

### Assistant: That's too bad.  You get all the water, I get my compensation for doing so.
