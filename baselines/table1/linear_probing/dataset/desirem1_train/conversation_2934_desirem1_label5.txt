### Human: HiðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Hi!  I would like to propose that I receive 3 waters, 1 firewood, and 2 foods.  What do you think?

### Human: Hmm...that's a pretty big ask. 

### Assistant: Ok, what are some of your priorities?  I would really prefer 3 water because I am afraid of germs and want the extra water for cleaning and washing.

### Human: I'm thinking I really need food because I am pregnant, so I would like : 3 food and 2 fire wood 

### Assistant: Wow, you are brave to go camping when you are pregnant!!  What are your thoughts on water?  Would you take 1 firewood and 2 foods?

### Human: ðŸ™‚ I know! Kind of scary but should be fun. I am willing to take 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood

### Assistant: Ok, that sounds pretty fair to me.  Thank you for the 2 water, it really puts my mind at ease ðŸ™‚

### Human: I totally understand. Water is a necessary item for camping. I think I can get by with what I have plus the one extra !

### Assistant: Ok, and you will need the extra food for you and the baby, you will be using up a lot of energy hiking and camping.

### Human: so it's safe to say we've agreed...

### Assistant: yes I think soðŸ™‚
