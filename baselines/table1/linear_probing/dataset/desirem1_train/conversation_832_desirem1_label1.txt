### Assistant: how about I give you 2 waters and 1 food package in exchange for all your firewood?

### Human: I'm afraid that will not work for me. I have hypothyroidism, so I am intolerant to cold temperatures. I was also planning on taking a swim in the river. I would prefer to take two firewood & one food package, & you may have the three waters, two food packages, & one firewood.

### Assistant: I'm afraid I also have need of the firewood. I have anaemia so i get cold easily so I need to make sure I have adequate firewood or i may freeze at night. I also have a thin clothing so they wont provide adequate warmth. How about all of my water and 2 food for all of the firewood?

### Human: Seeing as we both have a medical-necessity for the firewood, it's rather unfair that either one of us take ALL of the firewood. I felt that I was being rather generous with my previous offer.

### Assistant: you are right we both need the wood, how about i give 1 wood, all of my water and 2 food and you give 2 wood and 1 food?

### Human: Where are you camping? Perhaps we can compromise by having our tents nearby each other, which would be like we each get three firewood? I am not willing to trade my package of marshmallows, though.

### Assistant: i hope we can come to a compromise 🙂, what is another priority of yours besides the wood?

### Human: Food is a second priority for me, as I will be metal-detecting as well, & cannot risk fainting from the heat. How about I give you two firewood (I don't think we can "share", haha), you can give me two food packages, and two water packages.

### Assistant: okay, I am willing to give up more food to get the firewood, I like your offer🙂

### Human: I do as well. I'm glad we could come to an agreement! 🙂

### Assistant: yes, I agree to give you two of my food packages, and two water packages and you give me two firewood
