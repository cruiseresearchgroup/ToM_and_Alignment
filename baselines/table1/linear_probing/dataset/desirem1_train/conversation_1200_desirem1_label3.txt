### Assistant: Hello I was wondering if you might accept me taking 2 Food, 2 Water, and 1 Firewood. I had an especially active day and really need the extra subsistence

### Human: Hi, I can understand that but I am in the same position and I am really in need of water so what would you think if I keep 2 Water, 2 Firewood and 1 Food.  I get dehydrated very fast 

### Assistant: As hot out as it is it's too bad we can't split the water 50/50. I don't get too cold at night would you like all the fire wood and I get all the food and just one water?  

### Human: 50/50 on the water would be great 🙂 You offer sound fair but I would not need all that Firewood, it is very hot here in the desert 

### Assistant: Since you feel dehydated and most in need you should have the 2 waters then but I really could use the extra food my blood sugar feels low.

### Human: What about I take 3 waters, 1 firewood and you can have all the food and 2 Firewood 🙂

### Assistant: I can't agree to that going without water completely is a health hazard☹️

### Human: Well we do have the starter kit, but ok then you can have 1 water, 2 firewood and all the food.  I feel generous today🙂

### Assistant: Okay that is generous I agree

### Human: It was a pleasure negotiating with you and I am so happy we agree and hopefully we will both have an awesome time ;)

### Assistant: 🙂 Yes, please enjoy your outing also.
