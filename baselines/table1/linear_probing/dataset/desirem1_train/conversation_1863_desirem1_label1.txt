### Human: Hi, I'm hoping we can come to a nice deal. ðŸ™‚ I'm most interested in firewood, because it always helps to have extra if your fire goes out.

### Assistant: That makes sense. I'm also interested in firewood, but have a great need for water due to the current weather. 

### Human: That makes sense. How about we start out with I get 3 firewood, and you get 3 waters?

### Assistant: Great idea, that works for me. ðŸ™‚

### Human: Okay, let's do that, and then split the food. Since there are only 3, do you want to flip a coin to see who gets 2 of those?

### Assistant: That sounds fair, how much food do you feel you need? 

### Human: I would prefer 2 because it's really easy to underestimate how much I could need.

### Assistant: That's fine, I'll take 1. I think I have enough with what was originally given. 

### Human: Sounds good! So I get 3 firewood, 2 food, 0 water; you get 0 firewood, 1 food, 3 water?

### Assistant: That's sounds right. Thanks ðŸ™‚

### Human: Cool, I
