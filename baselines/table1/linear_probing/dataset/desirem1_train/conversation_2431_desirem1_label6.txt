### Human: hello?

### Assistant: Hi! How are you today

### Human: i'm pretty good, how are you?

### Assistant: Great!  I was wondering if you would mind sharing your top preferences on our three items?  What do you feel is your highest priority supply?

### Human: I suppose my highest priority is water, what do you think about maybe trying to split these up in an even way as possible?

### Assistant: Sounds great to me.  Excited for this camping trip.  My highest priority right now is food; I am bringing along a huge family and need to feed all of them, and they'll get super hungry without more packets!

### Human: Ok that sounds good. So, I suppose that we can agree that we'll both receive at least 1 of each of the three different items.

### Assistant: Sure.  how about I could get 2 food packages since that is my highest priority, and you could get 2 water packages?

### Human: That sounds reasonable to me.

### Assistant: Awesome.  And actually I would either be willing to have 1 water package and 2 firewood packages.  Would that be okay by you?

### Human: In that scenario, you'd be getting 1 extra item than me, but I'm not too worried about it because I'm sure if I needed to get extra firewood, I could find some in the wilderness.

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
