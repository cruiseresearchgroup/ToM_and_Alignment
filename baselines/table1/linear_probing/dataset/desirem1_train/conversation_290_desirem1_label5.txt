### Assistant: Hi there. Have you ever been camping?

### Human: I have, i love camping! How about you?

### Assistant: I have not, but I don't really have an interest for it, either.

### Human: Thats a shame, i am sure you would like it if you give it a try, especially if you build a large fire ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: I was going to say, the fire would be probably one of the few things I would be interested in! I love being warm.

### Human: Well you can take all the firewood if it will help, would it be ok if i get all the food in return?

### Assistant: That works for me. How would you like to divide the water?

### Human: I am ok with you taking two waters since you are new to camping, does that seem fair to you?

### Assistant: Yes, that seems fair to me.

### Human: So you get 3 firewoods and two waters and i get 3 foods and one water, deal?

### Assistant: we have a deal! great speaking with you today ðŸ™‚

### Human: Submit-Deal
