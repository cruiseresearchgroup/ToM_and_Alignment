### Assistant: Hello!  Great to see you, here for a hike to the Lake?🙂

### Human: Yes but I am going to camping trip🙂

### Assistant: Yeah, I am camping also.  My wife and mother-in-law are down geting the site permit and trail maps.  I'm trying to sort out our supplies.  We flew in and the airline loss the bag with our sleeping bags and food.☹️

### Human: Oh so sorry to hear that. I am also in a need of supplies. I am mostly worried about water as I do get dehydrated easily and cannot function properly like that😮. What are your concerns?

### Assistant: Well I see they have some extra supplies to split between the sites.  I really need food and firewood to help keep everyone happy. 

### Human: I would be happy to give you the entire food supply if I can get all the water. But I would like a minimum of two firewood because I also get very cold and am afraid of dark - so would have to burn it all night long. I would be scared to run out. Ideally would like to have all of it but I understand that you would need some.

### Assistant: Sounds good on the food and water, but my mother-in-law is going to give me a lot of grief if she sees a small pile of wood here.  Being that there is a fire pit between our sites can I convince you to let me have two of the wood and we can put on as much as we need to keep it going between us.   I really need points with my mother-in-law! 🙂🙂

### Human: I am going with my fiancee and she would "kill" me if I cannot secure enough firewood. I think I cannot budge on this. She will probably already be upset that I did not get more firewood.. 😮

### Assistant: That sounds tough to deal with also.  How about you take the two wood but I get a water?

### Human: Then I would need some food. ☹️

### Assistant: No that won't work.  I can survive with the 3 food for me, 3 water for you, and 2 firewood for you and 1 for me.  Shall we make that a deal?

### Human: So you would get 3 food and 1 firewood, yes. 🙂
