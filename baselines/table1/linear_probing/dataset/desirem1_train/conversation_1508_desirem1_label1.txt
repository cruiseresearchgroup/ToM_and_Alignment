### Human: Hi, how are you doing today? 🙂

### Assistant: Hi, i am well thank you. What of you..?

### Human: I'm doing well too

### Assistant: Good to know. Would kindly wish to request to have additional items for the camping

### Human: Not a problem. I can be fair. What are your preferences?

### Assistant: Additional food, firewood and water each by two

### Human: I was thinking we can make it a bit more equal and fair. Since I have three young children who have a condition where they get cold easily, I would like more firewood. How about 3 firewood packages for me and 1 food package. You can have 2 food packages and 3 water packages. How does that sound? 🙂

### Assistant: Since you have small children that seems fair. i am open to your suggestion

### Human: Okay that sounds great, thank you so much for understanding. Do we both agree on 3 firewood and 1 food package for me, and 2 food and 3 water packages for you?

### Assistant: Yes we have a deal

### Human: Great! I will submit the deal right now. Thank you! 🙂

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
