### Human: hey, I have a huge group of people camping with me, so of priority to me is food and water

### Assistant: What! That's too bad because i may need all packages of water. I came with kids who like playing with dirt.

### Human: what about I give you two of the water then, so I take three food and one water and some wood?

### Assistant: I will need at least one food too.

### Human: what about I give you all the water, can I have all the food and some wood?

### Assistant: If that is the case then you can do with one firewood because i need to keep my kids warm. I hope you understand.

### Human: that is fine

### Assistant: I am not sure though whether the food i have will last.

### Human: you already have five items and I have four, you still want more?

### Assistant: It is difficult being me right now. I could use more if it is possible.

### Human: I think that is the best deal I can offer you right now.

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
