### Human: Hi, how are you doing today?

### Assistant: I am fine. Thank you. How are you?

### Human: I'm doing well. I am going camping this weekend and just making a list of extra supplies that i need to bring

### Assistant: Wonderful! I am going camping this weekend too. This time Zen, Ken and Ben, my little kids, will join me.

### Human: Oh, that sounds like fun. I am going with some friends. What supplies do you plan on bringing?

### Assistant: We do need water the most and some food would be nice. We would use some firewood but it is not our priority. 

### Human: Oh, I would like to bring extra water too. Where I am going camping there isn't much fresh water around.

### Assistant: what is your least priority?

### Human: I don't need much firewood

### Assistant: Do you think we could have 2 of water, 2 of food and you can have 1 water, 1 food and 3 firewood?

### Human: Sure, that sounds fair.

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
