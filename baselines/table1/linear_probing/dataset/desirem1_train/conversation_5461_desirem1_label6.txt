### Assistant: Hi! I look forward to making a trade with you that's good for us both.

### Human: Me too, hopefully we can get together on a deal.

### Assistant: I'm hoping so too. What's most valuable to you?

### Human: Water, what about you? 

### Assistant: Food, but I definitely do need some water, too. Can you live with taking 2 waters?

### Human: Yes, can you live with two foods? 

### Assistant: I can. How about firewood? I would like 2 if possible.

### Human: Well there are only 3.

### Assistant: Of course. Since you're getting more water, I was hoping to get 2 firewood, and you could have the remaining 1. Would that work for you?

### Human: Water was my high priority and food was your's, so I think we already split the difference there. 

### Assistant: Okay, so how do you propose splitting the firewood?

### Human: Can we split a bundle, in the real world that would be cool.  

### Assistant: I wish we could. I would be down for that. ðŸ™‚ That seems the most fair to me. How about you enter the trade deal on your end?

### Human: Deal. 

### Assistant: Then let me pass it back to you, and you can enter the trade, then hit submit. I'll be ready.

### Human: Submit-Deal
