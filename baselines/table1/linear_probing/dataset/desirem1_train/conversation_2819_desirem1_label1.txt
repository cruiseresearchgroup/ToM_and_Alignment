### Assistant: Hello how are you doing today?

### Human: hello, doing great, how is the camping trip going?

### Assistant: I am getting ready for it. I was just thinking about the area I am going to, and depending on location you might need more of some supplies.

### Human: what do you think you may need more?

### Assistant: Well I am going to an area with less trees than normal. Usually I camp in the forest where you have firewood all around you. But this trip it might be hard to find.

### Human: what a coincidence, I will need more wood and lots of food. its very cold during the night

### Assistant: I don't think food will be an issue for me. Water would be harder to find but I think it should be a fun trip.

### Human: Water is no big deal for me, so you can have that, and can have the food and some wood?

### Assistant: Yeah I think we can work something out, how about I take 3 waters and just 1 food and firewood? Does that sound ok?

### Human: I want three food and two firewood and I am good

### Assistant: Ok I am fine with that exchange

### Human: Submit-Deal
