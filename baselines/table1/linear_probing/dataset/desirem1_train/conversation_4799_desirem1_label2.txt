### Assistant: Hi - I'm so excited for our camping trip.  I'm most excited about getting to eat food that I normally don't when I am home.

### Human: Hello! camper, how are you? I need us to make a deal where we all benefit.

### Assistant: I agree - I really love food.  If I don't get it, I get hangry ðŸ™‚.  If you're ok with me getting all the food, I think I can make it with just one firewood and one water.

### Human: What do you think if in the camp we get together and hold a meeting between your family and mine. We can have a small party so that we get to know each other better.

### Assistant: That sounds like an excellent idea.  I love meeting and getting to know others.

### Human: My main objective for the camp is also food, since I have a large family and the amount of food they give in the camp is very small for my whole family.

### Assistant: I can do without one of the food, so maybe I can get 2 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water?

### Human: I do not like the deal very much, but for that we must talk and decide as adults a good deal for both of us. What we want is to enjoy in the camp.

### Assistant: Agreed - I enjoy camping.  A big part of that for me is that I get to eat food.  If I don't eat, I don't enjoy it so camping is basically a buffet for me.  I am pretty dead set on having at least two packages of food.  I can negotiate the water and firewood.

### Human: How many members are there in your family group? To make a proposal taking into account the food you need according to your family group.

### Assistant: I have me, my wife, and my four kids.  They are all teenagers.  You know how they go through food ðŸ™‚.

### Human: Before making a deal I like to talk to people, to get to know them better. And if we are going to make a proposal for a party between the two families in the camp, it is in our best interest to know each other better.

### Assistant: Understood, but I don't know anything about you.  I've offered a lot of information about me.  This is a two-way street. ðŸ™‚  

### Human: My family is made up of my wife, my five children and me. All my children are minors, but they eat too much. When they don't eat they get very restless.ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: I think one teenage kid is equivalent to young children.  The least I'm willing to accept is 2 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water.  I don't see another option as you haven't provided me any.  Let me know so we can get on our own camping trips.

### Human: Ok, my proposal is to give you everything you need for food, because you have given me good reasons, on the condition that you give me everything I need for water and firewood. Because I can take some food to cook in the camp and I need a lot of firewood and water.

### Assistant: What is your proposal.  Everything meaning you get 3 firewood and 3 water is not going to work for me.  Let me know.

### Human: My proposal is to give you 2 foods, 1 water and 1 wood. I need water and firewood to cook in the camp. Unless you want 2 for water, 2 for reading, and 1 for food?

### Assistant: No thanks - I don't think we're going to come to a deal.  I hope you enjoy your camping trip.

### Human: Submit-Deal

### Assistant: Reject-Deal

### Assistant: Submit-Deal

### Human: Reject-Deal

### Human: I can offer you this other treatment: 3 Food, 0 Firewood and 1 Water. I'm giving you all the food. What does it say?
