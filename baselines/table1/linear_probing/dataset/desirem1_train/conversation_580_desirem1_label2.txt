### Assistant: Hello üôÇ What do you need most??

### Human: I would say between firewood and food, eating and comfort is important to me

### Assistant: I can understand that. I know I really need the food the most. I'm already worried I'm going to run out. I also have blood sugar problems, so I cannot run out ‚òπÔ∏è

### Human: Thats fine. If you want you can have 2 foods and I get 2 of the fire wood. Sounds fair?

### Assistant: And I would take 3 water? 

### Human: That would be a problem since I need the water too. I was hoping that since you got 2 foods ill get the 2 waters

### Assistant: Ok, I totally get that. So give me your total breakdown. I get how much of what, and you get how much of what?

### Human: So in total I would get 2 water, 2 fire wood, 1 food. 2 food 1 one of everything else 

### Assistant: What if I take 1 more firewood, so I would have 2?

### Human: I mean I would gladly trade a water and firewood for one of your extra food. 

### Assistant: No, I really do need the food the most. Let's go back to your original deal? I'll take 2 foods, you get one. I'll take 1 water, 1 firewood, and you take the rest? Do I have that right?

### Human: Yup

### Assistant: Deal

### Human: Submit-Deal
