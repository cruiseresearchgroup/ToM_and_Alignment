### Human: Hello there, How would you feel about trading supplies in this manner. 2 Water for me and 2 food , while you get 1 Food , 1 Water , and 3 Firewood?☹️

### Assistant: While that does sound like an okay deal I would much rather want more water. It is essential to satisfy thirst.

### Human: What if I give you an extra food?😮

### Assistant: Sorry I would really like more then 1 water 😡

### Human: Well I would really like 2 waters. Is there anything else you had in mind?

### Assistant: I get 3 waters and you can have everything else.🙂

### Human: I am going to have to refuse that. I would want at least 1 water. ☹️

### Assistant: What about 2 waters for me and 1 food and you can have everything else?🙂

### Human: That sounds promising but if possible I would like two waters.

### Assistant: Forget it then , dont take that deal then. 😡

### Human: Water is extremely important for me as it makes the whole day better in general.☹️
