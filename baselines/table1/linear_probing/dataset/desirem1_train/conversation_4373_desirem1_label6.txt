### Human: Hello there how are you? 🙂

### Assistant: Hi, I am doing well no complaints here. How are you doing today?

### Human: Pretty good as well, ill kick this off so you can know that i have a medical condition that makes me need a larger amount of water to stay hydrated

### Assistant: I completely understand you have a medical condition. How much water would you require? I have a family of 5 and water runs out quick for us with young kids.

### Human: Oh no this will be difficult,☹️ We have a large family as well with a breast feeding wife so food is important to us as well

### Assistant: This really is difficult my friend, I have a new born breast feeding as well! Unreal. How about you take the 2 packages of water since you have a med condition? And I get 3 firewood?

### Human: Im not sure about the firewood what about the food?

### Assistant: My family likes to have fires and cook on the fire pit around the clock. The food is not as big of a deal. Remember I am giving you 2 cases of water.🙂

### Human: Ok so 2 waters for me 3 food for me and you get all the firewood?

### Assistant: Deal🙂

### Human: Great  well im glad we made a quick deal. 🙂

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
