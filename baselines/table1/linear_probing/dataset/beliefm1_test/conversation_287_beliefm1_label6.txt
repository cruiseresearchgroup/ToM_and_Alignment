### Assistant: Hello, how are you?

### Human: I am great, thank you for asking, how about you?

### Assistant: Good, getting ready to spend a few days camping.

### Human: Me too, do you have any priority items that you really need?

### Assistant: I'm worried I did not bring enough water and there are no lakes or rivers around my site.

### Human: I know what you mean, water is really important for me aswell. How about firewood or food?

### Assistant: It's warm and I have packaged food so firewood is not a priority at all. I wouldn't mind some extra food.

### Human: so how about you get 3 foods and i get 3 firewood? That way we can get those off the table?

### Assistant: I mean I really would like to get a lot of water and I am willing to give up all the wood.

### Human: ok how about you get two waters and all the food, i get one water and all the firewood? That way you get one more item.

### Assistant: Yeah that works well for me.I drink a lot and its summertime LOL.
