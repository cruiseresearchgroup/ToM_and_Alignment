### Human: hello

### Assistant: Hi

### Human: ready for the camping trip?

### Assistant: Yes, I am excited ðŸ™‚

### Human: i am too, it is going to be really nice

### Assistant: Sure is. 

### Human: though i do think i am going to need some more firewood, you think you can help me with that?

### Assistant: I can give you firewood in exchange for a bulk of the water since I am trying to go on a water fast diet.

### Human: ya it can be very cold at night and the extra firewood can help with that. i do have some extra water for you

### Assistant: Great. That is a fair compromise. How much did you have in mind to exchange? 

### Human: 3 for 3?

### Assistant: Sounds good. So I give you 3 firewood and you give me 3 water?

### Human: correct

### Assistant: I can work with that. Now how would we divide the food? ðŸ˜®

### Human: i feel food should be kept the same, we both need it

### Assistant: I don't think we can divide the 3 packages of food equally right?

### Human: ya, we don't have to trade food

### Assistant: I think we may have to trade it. We still have to decide how much each both of us gets. Cause if you put 0 then that will give me all 3 food packages I think.

### Human: oh you are right

### Assistant: Yep. If you don't care too much of food do you mind if I keep 2 packages and you get 1 because I feel kind of hungry now. ðŸ™‚

### Human: i feel i can just walk away if that's the case, i am trying to set up the deal here and could use the extra 1 food

### Assistant: Walking away would be worse off for both our cases wouldn't it? Even if you got what you desired of 3 firewood and 1 food wouldn't it still be better than walking away?

### Human: sometimes i can be stubborn like that, especially with food

### Assistant: Ok I guess I will give in and you can have 2 food then.
