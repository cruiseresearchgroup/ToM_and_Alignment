### Human: Hey there. I really love camping. How's it going over there?

### Assistant: I do too! i can't wait to go.

### Human: So are there any supplies you are trying to collect extra of for this trip?

### Assistant: Yes! i really need to get extra water and some food for the big group going with me.

### Human: Oh what a coincidence! I also am trying to collect extra water and food to take care of the orphaned bears I came across near the camp site

### Assistant: Orphaned bears huh? Well, maybe if you could help freed some of the humans I'll be with we could share some with the bears. What if we get 2 food, 1 water, and 2 firewood for the humans?

### Human: hmmm I don't know about that. If you think that is a good deal, then let's reverse it so the bears can get what you suggest. ðŸ™‚The bears thank you!

### Assistant: I think the humans would be ok with 1 food, 2 water, and 3 firewood if the bears are really hungry

### Human: I see you are quite the negotiator. How about this? You can have 3 waters and 1 firewood and we'll call it even!

### Assistant: that's not really even. You're getting all of the food which we both need the most. so I'll take 3 waters and 2 firewood.

### Human: ok, well if you think what I offered was not even, I will take 3 waters and 1 firewoodðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
