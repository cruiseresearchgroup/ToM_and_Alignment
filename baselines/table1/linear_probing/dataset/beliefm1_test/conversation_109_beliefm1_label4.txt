### Human: Hi, I would like to have the water if you are ok with taking the firewood and food.

### Assistant: I would also like water, but don't need as much food

### Human: How about I take 2 water, 1 firewood, and 2 food?

### Assistant: What about if I take 2 water, 1 firewood, and 0 food?

### Human: Can I ask why you do not want food as much?

### Assistant: I think i have quite some ways to forage in the forest if i need more food, but i'm worried that i won't have enough water to last the trip

### Human: I understand. And why do you not need as much firewood?

### Assistant: i'm pretty good at making fire, but could use a little extra. how about you?

### Human: I'm not as good at making fire. I might need some extra.

### Assistant: would it sound decent to go with the solution of 2 water for me, 2 firewood for you, and i'm fine if you want 3 food?

### Human: I'm ok with that deal.

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
