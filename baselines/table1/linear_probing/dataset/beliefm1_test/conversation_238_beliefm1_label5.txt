### Human: ðŸ™‚ Hi how are you.

### Assistant: pretty good! Any chance you can spare some food? mine got wet when some of my water leaked out

### Human: Sure but I'm still pretty hungry myself, too. I can spare two food items for you. Did your water spill, too?

### Assistant: yeah. I lost about 2 bottles worth.Any way you can do 2 food and 2 water and i can give you 3 of my firewood

### Human: That wasn't really my preferences but it sounds like you really need it ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: what do you need the absolute most? ideally would like us to both help eachother

### Human: We both have the same preferences. I didn't have a disaster though lol

### Assistant: lol, I appreciate it ðŸ™‚. So 2 food and 2 water for me and 3 food for you?

### Human: Yeah let me try the deal. We can work with that.

### Assistant: sounds great and thanks again

### Human: Can you input the deal? ðŸ˜® I don't know what I'm doing.

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
