### Assistant: Hi, How are you?

### Human: Good how are things?

### Assistant: yeah. going good.

### Human: good to hear

### Assistant: How about the deal? 

### Human: Sure. My kids are really looking forward to this camping trip but one has special needs and he has to have a specific diet. I am fairly flexible on the water and firewood but food is a must have for me.

### Assistant: Okay. then I'll choose 2 food, 2 firewood and 1 water

### Human: You want two food or you're allowing me to have 2 food?

### Assistant: I want 2 food

### Human: My kids need the food. If you allow me to have two food I'll give you all the firewood

### Assistant: okay then I'll choose 1 food 3 firewood, and 2 water

### Human: It's a bit skewed towards you with all those items isn't it? If you want two waters then I'll need 3 food and one water. You can have all 3 firewood

### Assistant: Okay then I'll choose 0 food 3 firewood, and 2 water. you choose 3 food, 0 firewood and 1 water
