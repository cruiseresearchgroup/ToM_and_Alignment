### Human: i would like to have two firewood and one water

### Assistant: Are there any categories you are willing to work with me and compromise? find middle ground where we are both being taken care of and not just you?

### Human: ok i would take only one firewood and one water, but i still need three food

### Assistant: Thank you so much, would you be okay with 2 Food? what do you think? finding middle ground?
