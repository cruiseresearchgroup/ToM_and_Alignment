### Human: Hello

### Assistant: I have a large family and need a lot of food and water.

### Human: What is your top priority? 

### Assistant: I would like 3 food and 3 waters. You can have the firewood.üôÇ

### Human: That is not fair. You can have 3 waters if I can have 3 food. 

### Assistant: That isn't really fair either. Why do you need so much food?

### Human: How is it not fair? It's three of each for both of us. You wanted 6 of the 9 items. I need the food because I am diabetic and low blood sugar can kill me.

### Assistant: ‚òπÔ∏è I also need some food to feed my children. How about if I get two food, and two waters. That will give you one of each.

### Human: Absolutely not. How do you think that's fair? I'll take two food, two firewood and you can have the rest.

### Assistant: I was only speaking of food and water. I hadn't discussed firewood. I really don't need any since it's so hot out. But with 5 children I'm not sure if one package of food will be enoguh.

### Human: I tried to be patient. My offer is 2 food, 2 firewood, and you can have the rest. That leaves you with 5 items and I only get 4. You can accept this, or I will walk away.

### Assistant: üòÆ

### Human: Do you agree? I will get 2 food, 2 firewood. You get 1 food, 1 firewood, and 3 water.
