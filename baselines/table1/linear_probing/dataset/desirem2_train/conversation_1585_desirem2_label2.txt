### Human: Hello! Nice to meet you.ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Likewise, how are you today?ðŸ™‚

### Human: I'm doing fine, could be worse, You?

### Assistant: Same, just getting ready for my families camping trip. Ready to make memories in the desert. Do you have any preferences for the items?

### Human: That's nice, I am camping with the wife. Well I am camping near a stream so I don't need much water.

### Assistant: That works for us, we will need a ton of water being in the desert and having a family of 5. We will not need much firewood if you want that you can have it.

### Human: I need more food than anything, but probably some firewood too as I'll need to cook it.

### Assistant: How about I take 3 water, 1 food and 1 firewood? How does that sound?

### Human: How about you take 3 water and I take 3 food and  we negotiate more on the firewood?

### Assistant: Sure. I only need one firewood. Does that work?

### Human: Sure, that sounds good.

### Assistant: Please submit the deal.ðŸ™‚
