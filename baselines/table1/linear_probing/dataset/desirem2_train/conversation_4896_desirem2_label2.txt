### Assistant: hi i was wondering if i could maybe get 2 of the water since i left half of mine at home‚òπÔ∏è and you could take 1 water if you need? does this sound ok?

### Human: I'm sorry ‚òπÔ∏è. I brought my dogs so I would need 2 bottles for me. You could have 1. I would give you all my firewood since I would not use it.

### Assistant: okay that sounds wonderful i broke my leg and am only camping with kids so they cant help me gather firewood so it is ok if i take all three firewood? so kind of you!

### Human: Yes of course, you can have all of it. üôÇ

### Assistant: ok, so what do we think about the food? do you need any food at all? what are your thoughts? lets come to a good compromise!

### Human: Sounds great, I would want all the food. Would hope that you can manage with some food of your own, I guess this would not be a difficult task. I cannot cook so any pre-packaged food would be good for me and my dogs.üôÇ

### Assistant: what kind of dogs do you have? do they eat a lot? i know small dogs tend to eat less so maybe all the packages could be too much for u guys

### Human: I do have a poodle and a yorkie and maltese mix. The poodle is standard size, that baby eats a bit!üôÇ I guess I would also need extra food since I would be cutting my own firewood and that would mean I would need to hike a bit.

### Assistant: the dog i grew up with was a toy poodle!! they are such cute and smart pups!!!! i wish i had a standard poodle now. i have a boxer and hes a silly nut! i understand why you need extra. i was just trying to at least get two for my trip for the kiddos. we had some kids join last minute and i definitely dont have enough to feed them all. 

### Human: Sorry to hear, however too many can jeopardize the trip. It can also be dangerous to bring so many kids since any of them could get sick or worst scenario that would get into some kind of trouble. If I were you I would not bring such large group. I definitely need all the food given since it has been a while that I do not camp or have a vacation so that is why I would love to bring my dogs along. 

### Assistant: well i didnt have a choice to bring them but here we are lol. but could you at least give me one package of food?

### Human: I am sorry, I could give you an extra water and I keep 1. I do need the food and you do have a choice, you can just be honest to them and let them know you don't have enough food.I believe that too many people can definitely jeopardize.‚òπÔ∏è
