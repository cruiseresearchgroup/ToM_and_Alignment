### Assistant: Hey! Nice getting to interact with you and let's have a nice and enjoyable camping trip!

### Human: Hi nice to meet you. We should have an enjoyable camping trip.

### Assistant: I would need additional packages of water as I get dehydrated quickly. Let me know your requirements.

### Human: I need additional Firewood because I am so cold at night. I also get dehydrated and get leg cramps in the middle of the night if I don't drink enough water.

### Assistant: Ok, get it as you are need of additional firewood, we can possibly have a fair deal of water and firewood then, 2-1 of former and 1-2 of latter.

### Human: Are you saying I could get 2 additional firewood and 1 additional water?

### Assistant: Yes

### Human: What about the food? How should we share it? Can I have 2 and you have 1?

### Assistant: hmm, that needs a bit of thought

### Human: I have my grandkids with and they are always hungry.

### Assistant: I have to give in for that, you can have 2 of it.

### Human: Submit-Deal
