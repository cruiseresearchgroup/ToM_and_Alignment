### Human: Hi, I think I should take two firewood, one food, and one water. 

### Assistant: Hi, I hope we can work together to find an offer that benefits both of us. Do you agree?ðŸ™‚

### Human: I agree!

### Assistant: Ok, could you tell me which item is the most valuable to you?

### Human: The firewood is most valuable to me because I get very cold at nighttime. Which is most valuable to you?

### Assistant: My most valuable item is Firewood too since my knee is injured and I won't be able to pick it up at camp. And the least valuable?

### Human: Water is least valuable to be because I can find my own water while camping. How about you?

### Assistant: My least valuable item is food because I'm thinðŸ™‚

### Human: Ok, I will need at least 1 firewood

### Assistant: What do you think of this offer: I give you 2 firewood and 1 food and what is left for me.

### Human: I would need 1 water just in case I can't find any drinking water

### Assistant: Remember that we already have the basic supplements for the camp, these are only extra items. And you have 2 of the most valuable, water is nothing for you.

### Human: There are a total of nine items, giving me 2 firewood, 1 food, and 1 water would still leave you with a majority of the items. 

### Assistant: What really matters is not the quantity but the value of each item. Please collaborate.

### Human: I think what I am asking is fair in value. Let's pretend it's dollars. Firewood=3$. Food=2$. Water=1$. My 2 firewood, 1 food, 1 water would be 9$. Your 1 firewood, 2 water, and 2 food would also be 9$.

### Assistant: We cannot pretend that because that is not how it works. I think you don't understand. Now i want 2 firewoods and 2 waters.1 food.
