### Assistant: Hi! How about I receive 3 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water?

### Human: I can't do that. It would leave me with no food at all. How about I take 2 food, and 1 firewood, and 1 water?

### Assistant: I really need more food than 1. I am worried about running out. I could take 2 food, and give you 1 food, 2 firewood, and 2 water.

### Human: That is a very generous offer, which I very much appreciate. But I am also worried that I could run out. What if I take 2 foods, give you 2 firewoods, and 1 water?  

### Assistant: Would you be willing to give me 1 food, 2 firewood, and 2 water?

### Human: I could make that work ðŸ™‚ I'm sorry if I came off mean, I'm just trying to make sure I'll be ok. I don't camp often, so I'm not sure how to prepare.

### Assistant: I understand. What are you using the extra food for?

### Human: I brought some pre-packed snacks, and a few sandwiches. I'm hoping there are no hungry animals around. What about you?

### Assistant: I was hoping to get some extra food for some picky eaters, but if they are hungry they will eat!

### Human: Oh no! I know how picky eaters can be. I'm sorry to hear that. So are you thinking I'll give you the one food, and 2 firewoods, and 2 waters? Will that work for you?

### Assistant: Yes, that works.

### Human: Deal!
