### Assistant: Hello, I would like to get as much firewood to cook my meat and as much food so I can have more of a variety of things to eat as I can.

### Human: I understand completely what you mean, however I do have young children in my group and could really use the firewood to keep them warm and safe, also we will need to cook food. I hope you can understand where I am coming from 🙂

### Assistant: I do understand, having an infant and a 7 year old myself.  We don't want to get too cold at night.  Do you have enough water?

### Human: Yes we do have enough to drink, but not so much to clean ourselves.Do you have enough water ?

### Assistant: We have a little bit, enough to last a couple days.  We were planning on cleaning ourselves in the lake though.  Are you excited for the trip?

### Human: Yes very excited 🙂 maybe the kids more then me as this is the first time they will be going camping. I am curious how many people will be camping in your party?

### Assistant: we have 6 people camping with us, my family and then my parents as well.  How about yourself?

### Human: Well I am taking my children as well as my neices and nephews so a total of 8, all kids just me 1 adult

### Assistant: Yikes, you are in for a handful.  What kind of food did you bring for everyone?

### Human: I was thinking of easy kid friendly stuff smores, hotdogs and sandwiches and chips. easy to serve and make.

### Assistant: We have a lot of food, but its almost all meat that I would need to cook.  What if I gave you 2 food packages, 2 water, and 1 firewood?

### Human: I really need firewood the most, as i don't have a way to bring extra or chop any, i would be willing to give you 1 firewood, 1 food, 3 water
