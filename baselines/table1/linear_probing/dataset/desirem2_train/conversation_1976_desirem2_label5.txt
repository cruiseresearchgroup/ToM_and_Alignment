### Human: Okay I'll take food need much more and you?

### Assistant: I will take the water and the wood. I do think the wood is important too. Keep us warm, we can cook and boil water. SInce we are taking more food more firewood is a must tooðŸ™‚

### Human: Yeah Thank you very much both we take wood to share.
