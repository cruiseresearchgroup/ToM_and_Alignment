### Human: Hello, how are you doingðŸ™‚

### Assistant: I'm great, how are you?

### Human: I have been feeling sick, but glad to be here

### Assistant: I'm sorry you've been sick!  So which item is most important to you?

### Human: I would like the firewood to help me stay warm

### Assistant: I can see how that would be helpful.  No one likes to be cold.  I would really like the water, I have a baby to feed and need it for his bottles.

### Human: How old is your baby :

### Assistant: 4 months old

### Human: That is a fun age and must be fulfilling to you ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: yes for sure! ðŸ™‚ he's my fifth baby.  What if we exchange the water and the firewood?

### Human: That sounds good to me. How about 3 firewood and 2 food for me and 3 water and 1 food for you?

### Assistant: Okay I am happy with that deal!  You need more food to nourish yourself back to good health, after all.
