### Human: Hi there.  I'm looking forward to this camping trip but I tend to get a little cold at night.  I'm hoping we can make a deal for some of the extra firewood.

### Assistant: Hello, it sounds like we can work something out. I find it hard to hunt or fish, so I am looking for some extra food

### Human: Sounds like something we can split equitably then.  My metabolism is kind of slow so I don't usually need to eat that much. ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Well that's good!

### Human: I agree.  So could I trade you the extra food for the firewood?  And we'll have to figure out what to do with this spare water, I suppose.

### Assistant: Ok, I am more than happy to give you 3 firefood for 3 food?

### Human: I'm perfectly happy with that.  Do you have suggestions on how to split the water between us?

### Assistant: Well one of us can get 2 and the other can get 1, since there are 3 we can't evenly split it

### Human: Right.  Would you be okay if we just flip a coin, if it's just of equal importance to the both of us?

### Assistant: Yes that would be fine, you can flip it and I will trust you. I choose tails

### Human: Looks like 2 to you then.  So I'll receive 3 firewood, 1 water, and 0 food.  You'll receive 3 water, 2 food, 0 firewood?

### Assistant: Yes, I get 3 food, 2 water, 0 firewood. And you get 0 food, 1 water, 3 firewood. It's a deal
