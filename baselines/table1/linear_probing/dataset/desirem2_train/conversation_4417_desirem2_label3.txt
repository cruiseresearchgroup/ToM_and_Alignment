### Assistant: hi,are you a first time camper here

### Human: Hello.  No I'm not a first time camper.  I'm a Girl Scout Troop Leader.  I'm excited to take my troop.  It's their first time. 

### Assistant: That means you probably came prepared. My son packed for us and i think he believes it's winter as we have lots of wood but not enough water. You wouldn't have any water you could spare, would you

### Human: We could trade for some of your wood.  The girls are working on their fire starting badge and their cooking over an open fire badge.  ðŸ™‚  

### Assistant: Thanks, we didn't really want to carry this around all day

### Human: Great.  We can set up camp, and the girls can practice.  The co-leader is worried about insurance liability of the girls using an ax.  LOL!

### Assistant: Let's hurry because I want to get as far away as possible from girls with an axðŸ˜¡

### Human: We can trade your extra wood for our extra water, but we will need food to cook.

### Assistant: my boys will need to eat also as they will need their energy to fend off the ax wielding girls, i think an even swap of wood for water is very fair ðŸ™‚

### Human: I have 12 Girl Scouts so I will need at least 2 of the food packages.  ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: You have my boys greatly outnumbered and you have axes, i think i saw this once in a horror movie, i can do 3 woods for 3 waters, and i'll even throw in one food as long as it's a donation and tax deductibleðŸ™‚
