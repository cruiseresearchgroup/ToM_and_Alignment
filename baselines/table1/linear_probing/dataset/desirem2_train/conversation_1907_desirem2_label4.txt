### Assistant: hi how are you

### Human: I am well, thank you.  Yourself?

### Assistant: good here, I will need 3 water as I need it to survive

### Human: I need water as well.  I require it for subsistence

### Assistant: how many water you need?

### Human: In a perfect world, all the water ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: that won't be fair, how about I get 1 water, 3 food and 1 firewood, that way u get the most water

### Human: Interesting.  If I decided to forgo water completely, would you accept giving me everything else?

### Assistant: no, at the most i can do is i get 2 water, 2 food and 0 firewood or I get 1 water, 3 food and 1 firewood

### Human: But you get everything you wanted. You said you needed 3 water, I offered it to you.

### Assistant: but i can't give you 3 food and 3 firewood, thats 6 items vs the 3 water

### Human: Sure you can.  If you really want water the most, why would you care about the rest as much?ðŸ˜®
