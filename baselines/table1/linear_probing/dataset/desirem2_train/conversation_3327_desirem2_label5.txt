### Assistant: Hello! I'm excited to go camping. ðŸ™‚

### Human: Same here, Its the first time our family of 7 are embarking on this adventure!

### Assistant: Holy cow family of 7! I can barely keep up with our family of 3 haha.

### Human: Yes, that's the normal reaction I get BUT I seriously love this family. 

### Assistant: Well that's great! I imagine you'll need extra supplies then. What would be most beneficial?

### Human: You can easily guess, its food!

### Assistant: Haha yeah I figured. Shoots well I do need extra food as well. My son is 15 and seems to go through 15000 calories a day.

### Human: I have 4 teenager younger boys sprouting everyday.

### Assistant: You must work four jobs. Okay you certainly have a legit reason so how's this... You take 2 of the foods, let me have all the water, and you can take all the firewood.

### Human: Can I exchange a pack of water for firewood?

### Assistant: I'll give you a pack of water for 2 firewoods then.

### Human: Submit-Deal
