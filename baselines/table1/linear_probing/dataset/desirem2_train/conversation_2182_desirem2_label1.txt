### Assistant: Hello!üôÇ I am going camping at Joshua Tree NP in very warm and dry conditions. We have a pretty large group.  I am looking to take the extra water and firewood. The evenings will be cool and there is not much wood there.

### Human: Hi.. I can understand your concern. I'll be okay to share with you water packs.my area is covered by full winter. I need at least 2 pack of firewood.üôÇ

### Assistant: üòÆ Thanks for considering my water needs . . . I can see that the firewood would be important for you. I could give up two of the firewood to you, but that would be a problem.  We were planning to do some hunting and cook some of our food.  Without the firewood, I would need to bring more food.  I am willing to give you two of the firewood packages if you could leave the 3 food packages for me.  We have a large group and about one/third of them are college-age--they like and need to eat.üôÇ

### Human: i'm happy to hear that you are considering my  need. I have 2 children in my house. I need at least ! pack of food to feed them. Kindly consider it.

### Assistant: I am willing to do that.  You can take two of the firewood and one food, and I will take the water, other firewood and 2 food packages. Do you agree?üôÇ

### Human: I need 1 pack of water, 1 pack of food, 2 pack of fire wood.  Totally i will take 4 packs.  You are going to take 5 packs.‚òπÔ∏è

### Assistant: I think it is important to consider that it is about need, not just about evenness of distribution. You are going to be camping in wintry, snowy conditions where a lot of water is not needed.  I urge you to reconsider my offer. If you are just going with your immediate family, you should be fine.  I have over 20 in my group. 

### Human: if in this case, You take 3 pack of water and provide me 3 pack of firewood. Will this okay for u?

### Assistant: What about the food?

### Human: 1 pack of food is enough for me. You take 2 pack. I think this will work for you.

### Assistant: Sorry, that won't work for me.‚òπÔ∏è Without enough extra food, I will need more firewood.  My counter offer is to take the three waters and three food. I am running out of time, and if we don't work out a deal, then we'll both suffer.  Please reconsider.

### Human: Please consider. I'm ready to share  you 2 pack of food. 3 pack of water. I just need only one food. Without food, my children will suffer. That is the main reason. kindly consider it.

### Assistant: No, that won't work for me.  I will make a final offer or I walk away.  I will take the water, and two firewood, and you can take the food which you  and one firewood. That is my final offer or I will have to walk away.

### Human: ‚òπÔ∏è Why suddenly changed your decision? As you already mentioned, I'll take 3 firewood. 1 pack water. You take other things. If this is not fine, let me know we'll come for an conclusion.
