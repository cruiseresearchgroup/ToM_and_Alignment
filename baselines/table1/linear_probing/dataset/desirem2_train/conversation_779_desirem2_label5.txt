### Assistant: Hello

### Human: hi

### Assistant: what is your preference for a deal?

### Human: I would like to get a higher number of food.  I can give you some wood or water in exchange

### Assistant: If I let you win on food, I am gonna need to win on water and firewood

### Human: I will give you 2 wood and 2 water for any food you can give

### Assistant: Ok, but i really need some food aswell, I cant give it all

### Human: that is why I said any food you can give, even it its just 1

### Assistant: How about this. You get 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood

### Human: And what would you like in return

### Assistant: 1 food, 2 water, and 2 firewood. I am not doing so well on water and in the event of an emergency, it's very important to me

### Human: That is fine with me.  Is that the deal that you want?
