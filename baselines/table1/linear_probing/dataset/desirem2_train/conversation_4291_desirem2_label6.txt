### Human: Hi there ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Hello, i was thinking i could have 3 of the firewood because i forgot we are staying longer and we will nee as much as we can get to cook and stay room

### Human: Is firewood the item you need the most?

### Assistant: yes i would need more firewood for camping

### Human: I could give you more firewood if you let me have the food and water. While I could use firewood, I'll stay hydrated and nourished to help my body keep warm.

### Assistant: I could give you all the 3 of the food packages if you give me all 3 firewoods. How does that sound

### Human: I would like the 3 water as well

### Assistant: i would like at lease 1 of the waters. I would think it only fair

### Human: I would rather give you 1 of the food

### Assistant: I dont really need  much food but i dont need some more water. You coul have 2 water an i would only get one?

### Human: Water is my most valued item. If you get all of your most valued, I'd want all of mine

### Assistant: okay i can do that then. So i get 3 of the firewoods and you get 0. You get 3 waters and i get 0. An you get 2 food packages and i get 1. Correct? Do we have a deal?

### Human: Works for me

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
