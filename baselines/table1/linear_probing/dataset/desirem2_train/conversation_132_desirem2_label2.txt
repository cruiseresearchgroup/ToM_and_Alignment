### Human: Hello

### Assistant: HI how are you today?

### Human: Good. I am diabetic so would like to take 3 of the food

### Assistant: I would do that but our meat spoiled because the ice box was not properly closed. How about you get 2 of the meat, and I get 3 of the water?

### Human: ok I will just be able to get by with 2 of the food, I can give you all 3 of the water if I can take 2 of the wood. I have panic attacks in the dark.

### Assistant: Okay that works for me as well.

### Human: awesome any chance I could persuade you to substitute your 1 food item for an additional fire wood ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: No I cannot do that unfortunately. We brought just enough food for our weekend trip, and I cannot lose any or we will run out before our camping trip is over.

### Human: OK, just thought I'd ask, so are we settled on you getting 1 Food, 1 firewood and 3 waters?

### Assistant: Yes that sounds like it will work for me.

### Human: Great. Have a good day
