### Human: I think I need more water because I take medicine and it gives me dry mouth. So I think I should have 2 more waters, 2 more food packages and 2 more firewoods. I'm not the best at camping. And I need all the help I can get.

### Assistant: Hello! I totally get it. But, since my nephew will be joinging me on this trip, I won't be able to spar that much.

### Human: I completely understand. But since you're taking your nephew, you must be confident in this camping trip. Whereas I am not. I'm new to this. So I really do need those supplies. I don't know how to hunt or fish. I'm sure you'll understand.

### Assistant: I am a bit used to camping and that is why i prefer to bring extra food for two. Just in case the wildlife there isn't abudant.

### Human: That's a good idea. ðŸ™‚ So since you already have extra I think my offer is pretty good.

### Assistant: Okay, how about this. You get 3 firewood, 2 water. I get alll food, 1 water?

### Human: That actually sounds pretty good all but the water. I need that extra water. So how about I agree to 2 firewoods, I''ll take you up on all the food since that may be a problem for me but I still need all of the waters.

### Assistant: Thats sound fine

### Human: Ok. Great.ðŸ™‚ So just to verify I'll have 3 waters, 2 firewoods and 3 food packages. 

### Assistant: Nope. I get the 3 food items.

### Human: Yes that's right. sorry about that. you get 3 foods and 1 firewood. and i get 3 waters and 2 firewoods. 

### Assistant: Yep, that's it.
