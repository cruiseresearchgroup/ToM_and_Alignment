### Human: Hello! I want to make a purchase of some essential needs for me and my family.

### Assistant: Hello, the trip sounds like it will be a lot of fun.  What is the most important essential package for you and your family?  I know we didnt bring a lot of food so I am looking for more of that than anything else.

### Human: Yes! Hope for lot of fun. Is there any special deal can you offer for maximum order.

### Assistant: What item are you looking for the most of?  

### Human: Water and food is on high need than the firewood. Expect for the best combo for food and water.

### Assistant: I brought plenty of water.  I think I could give you all 3 water. Food is what I need the most of so wonder if I took 2 packages of food and left you 1?

### Human: It's better to give 2 packages on both 

### Assistant: 2 packages of both of what?  Water and food?

### Human: I mean water and food

### Assistant: Is food something you need the most of or is it water?

### Human: I need 2 packages of both food and water on each

### Assistant: Food is a hard one to give 2 packes of since I dont have very much and need to feed my family.  We do have plenty of water though.  Would you be willing to take 3 packages of water and only get 1 package of food?
