### Human: Hello!

### Assistant: hi there

### Human: Looking forward to your camping trip?

### Assistant: Yes. I need to trade with you some camping items.

### Human: Yes definitely. I know I'm especially looking for food. We're camping for a couple weeks and we need to make sure to bring enough. What's your priority?

### Assistant: I needed water and food also because I am diabetic. I often get thirsty and hungry a lot

### Human: Hmm. I would be willing to give you three packages of water, if I could have three packages of food. Maybe we could split up the firewood so we can both cook some food on our camping trip.

### Assistant: How about I get two water for me and 1 for you? I give you 3 firewood

### Human: I would be good with that if I could still have three packages of food. 

### Assistant: I cant have no food at all or Ill die. How about two water for me and 1 for you? then 2 food for me and 1 for u? u get 3 firewood

### Human: How about two food for me & 3 firewood and you can have all the water and 1 food. 

### Assistant: How about 2 water, 2 food and  2 firewood for me, then you get the rest?
