### Human: Hi, we are going to be camping neighbors it seems like. üôÇ

### Assistant: Hi! It does seem that way.  Do you have any kids?

### Human: Yes actually, 2 of them. A boy and girl.

### Assistant: Nice, Maybe ours can play together some.  I know mine seem to fight less when they have other people to play with

### Human: I think having extra kids around always helps keep them out of trouble.

### Assistant: It looks like we have some extra packages that need to be divvied up.  Is there anything you prefer? 

### Human: I was just going to ask you the same question. I would prefer more firewood considering there isn't much to source at the camp site and all our sleeping bags are for lighter weather. I'd like to keep the kids warm. Other than that water would be nice too. They always dump it out thinking they are watering plants.. :(‚òπÔ∏è

### Assistant: We brought plenty of water and a filtration system because I am anal about hydration.  üôÇ

### Human: That's always a good thing. I had one but the kids left it in the sand... üò° What packages do you feel you need most?

### Assistant: My kids eat all the time so I can take the food and you can take the water and that will leave the firewood.  I wish they had 4 packages so we could divide it evenly.  We cook mostly on the fire and always sit around the fire at night. 

### Human: That would be nice, it would make things abit more fair. I really need a little fire wood for keeping the kids more warm though. I can bring a propane stove so I think 1 extra bundle would work for us. I wouldn't mind giving up 2 food for you and the kids, I can manage with what I have on hand and I can take 2 waters. Does that seem fair?

### Assistant: Sounds good.  I will take 2 food, 2 firewood and 1 water leaving you with the rest.
