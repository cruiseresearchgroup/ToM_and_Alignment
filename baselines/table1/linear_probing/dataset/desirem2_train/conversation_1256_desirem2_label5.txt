### Human: Hello, I'm in a strong need for food and water. Please let me have a few packages of food and water. I'd gladly trade all my firewood for it.

### Assistant: Hello. Wow! That does not sound good. My sister just called and let me know she will be coming tonight. She is bringing food so i have plenty to share. 🙂

### Human: That's some good news. 🙂 Are you sure she is going to be bringing food with her?

### Assistant: Yea She is bring tons of food. So don't worry we have plenty of food to spare. 🙂 She did forget to get water. I didn't know she was coming so i didn't grab any and I forgot the 3 packages of water for myself at the store. ☹️

### Human: Yikes, that's not good. Water is very important, especially if you now have to take care of two people at your campsite now. I do have 3 packages of water but I don't think I can spare it all.

### Assistant: I tell you what if we trade 3 food for 3 waters! I think that would be fair snice you said you need some food and snice I need some water. 🙂

### Human: Well, I do have some food but if I trade you all 3 packages of water, I won't have any at all. How about 2 packages of water, so we each have 1 package, including your sister?

### Assistant: How about this it think it will work out better for us and you snice you need fire wood too. You get 3 food and 2 firewood and and I get 3 water and 1 firewood. 🙂🙂

### Human: I really don't want to be without water, how about 2 water and 2 firewood for the 3 packages of food?

### Assistant: I just want to make sure I understand you I get 2 waters and 2 firewood and 0 food. 

### Human: That's right. Since you would be getting food from your sister, while I am camping alone, you would be getting more food pretty soon. 

### Assistant: umm. I think the best and fair deal is a complete swap of water for food and you get 2 fire wood.
