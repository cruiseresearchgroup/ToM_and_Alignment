### Human: Hello. I am all packed for my camping trip and am excited to get going!

### Assistant: I am excited too. I hope it will be fun.

### Human: I am a little worried I won't have enough firewood. Are you short on any supplies?

### Assistant: Yes. I need extra packages of firewood too and water.

### Human: Well, I am sure we can come up with a way to divide the supplies so we are both comfortable!

### Assistant: I will need at least 2 firewood. Will that be okay? I can give up 2 food for you.

### Human: That sounds good. 

### Assistant: Okay. Thank you. I knew we could find something working for us.

### Human: Now just the water, can I take 2 of the water since I only will get one of the firewood?

### Assistant: I am requesting 2 waters too. I am with my kids and they like playing with water so i know they will waste a lot

### Human: OK, I can live with that!

### Assistant: Thank you so much for understanding. Now i am not worried. Do we have a deal?

### Human: Submit-Deal

### Assistant: Reject-Deal

### Assistant: This is not what we had agreed.☹️

### Human: Submit-Deal
