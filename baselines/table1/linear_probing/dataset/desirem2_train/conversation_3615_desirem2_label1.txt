### Human: Hi, I would like to get firewood because I would like to sit by the campfire in the evening.

### Assistant: Hi there. I was really hoping to have the firewood because I am afraid my children would be cold.

### Human: Ok, so we have 3 packages, what about if you get 2 and I get 1?

### Assistant: Thank you, 2 packages of firewood would work.

### Human: So could I get 2 food, if you get 1 food?

### Assistant: How many persons are you feeding? I am feeding 2 adults and 2 children.

### Human: 2 adults and 3 children, so if I get 2 food and 1 water, you could get 1 food and 2 water? 

### Assistant: I believe we can work with 1 food and 2 waters.ðŸ™‚
