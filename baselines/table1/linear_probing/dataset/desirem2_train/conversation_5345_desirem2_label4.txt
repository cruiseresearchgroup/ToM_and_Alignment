### Assistant: Hi, how is your trip going? hopefully better than mine

### Human: My trip is going pretty so so too  im sorry to hear that about yours!! sounds like we both are gonna need some extra stuff? I was wondering if we could start with the water? any chance i could have it all and you can have all of something else? thoughts? im open to discussion

### Assistant: I am actually very much in need of water. I fell while I was hiking during this trip. I have a really bad wound I need to clean on my leg. 

### Human: yikes that stinks. i got some extra people with me and we dont hve enough either. could i take 2 since we will be drinking it and maybe you can have 1 to get that wound cleaned up

### Assistant: There is a lot of blood on my wound and if I don't get it cleaned I am afraid I would have to have it amputated. It's likely I'll be stationary a long time. Maybe I can give you 2 water in exchange for 2 foods since I'll be stuck up here for a long time? 

### Human: oh no!!!!! sounds like you shouldnt be camping at all. thats insane that happened. youre definitely in my thoughts. uhm i guess i have no choice since your situation is dire. so to be clear youre saying i can have two water and you can have two wood? if so thats ok with me

### Assistant: I would give you 2 water in exchange for 2 of your food supplies

### Human: im sorry i mistyped. okay yes thats a deal. so last we have to talk about the wood. what do you think

### Assistant: Oh yes, sorry I am so caught up with my wound I completely forgot about that. I can spare 1 firewood so you would get 2, do you think you could spare another water in exchange for the wood?

### Human: i cant unfortunately i really need the two water im sorry. 

### Assistant: Submit-Deal

### Human: Reject-Deal

### Human: im so sorrry unfortunately i am in dire need of two wood we are in a very cold climate

### Assistant: how about i get 1 water, 2 food, and 2 firewood since I'll be here so long? because of my leg i likely won't be able to leave anytime soon

### Human: Submit-Deal

### Assistant: Reject-Deal

### Assistant: What about I give you more food in exchange for you giving me more water? I could give you 2 food and you give me an extra water?

### Human: unfortunately that doesnt work for me. i am afraid i will not be able to discuss this any further my final offer is i get 2water 2food and 1wood

### Assistant: can we meet in the middle? if we cannot come to an agreement we both get nothing and we both lose. i am in dire need of the water to keep my leg from having to be amputated. i have children at home i take care of and i can't live without my leg

### Human: Submit-Deal

### Assistant: Reject-Deal

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
