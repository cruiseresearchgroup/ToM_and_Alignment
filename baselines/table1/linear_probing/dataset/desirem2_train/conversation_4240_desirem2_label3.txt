### Human: Hello how are you?

### Assistant: Hey there fellow camper! I am great! How are you?

### Human: I'm doing well and very excited about my camping trip.

### Assistant: Me as well. What item is your greatest priority for your trip?

### Human: Firewood and my second priority is water.  I'm open to negotiating though.

### Assistant: Glad to hear because I really need firewood and food. What do you propose?

### Human: I can give you 3 packages of food but I really need the additional firewood.

### Assistant: I like that. How about 3 water for you and 1 firewood?

### Human: I can give 3 packages of food and 1 water.  

### Assistant: So 1 firewood, 0 food and 3 water for you?

### Human: No 3 packages of firewood, 1 package of water, and I can give you 3 packages of food.  I need the Firewood the most.

### Assistant: Tell me why you need so much firewood?

### Human: I have other people coming with me and we don't have insulated sleeping bags.  The temperature also drops drastically at night.

### Assistant: Well i need at least 1 firewood so we have to make that work
