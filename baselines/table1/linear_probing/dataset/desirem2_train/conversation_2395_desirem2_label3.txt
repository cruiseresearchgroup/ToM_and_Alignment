### Assistant: Hi, I really need water to stay hydrated during my camping trip because my food supplies are low. Do you have any to spare?

### Human: Hi.  I can't do that right now.

### Assistant: Is there anything that you might need? 

### Human: I would be interested in firewood.  Can I ask you, what are your primary concerns on this trip?

### Assistant: My primary concerns are staying hydrated, I have been feeling sick and throwing up from being so high up in the mountains. 

### Human: Oh, so sorry to hear that.  I can understand why water would be important to you.  I am worried about being too cold at night. My sleeping bag is not rated well for cold weather (I packed the wring one).

### Assistant: Oh I understand that for sure. I am not used to the cold weather either which is not helping. Would you be interested in a trade for water in exchange for firewood? 

### Human: Well, I am worried about staying hydrated as well.

### Assistant: Do you have food? I have been trying to hunt but have not really found any animals nearby to hunt.

### Human: I do actually!  I can give you 3 foods. Would that work?

### Assistant: Sure, I can do that.

### Human: So if I give you 3 woods, can you give me 3 firewoods and 2 waters?

### Assistant: Yes that sounds like a great deal

### Human: OK great.  Please stand by. 

### Assistant: Submit-Deal

### Human: Reject-Deal
