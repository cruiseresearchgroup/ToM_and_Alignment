### Human: Good evening. I would like to have 2 food 2 water and 1 firewood please üôÇ

### Assistant: Hello. I was actually trying to get 3 food, 3 firewood and 3 water...my kids have been looking forward to this camping trip for such a long time, and I want to make sure everything goes smoothly.

### Human: I understand but that would mean you get everything and i get nothing. How is that fair? ‚òπÔ∏è

### Assistant: That's true. Can I get 3 food, 2 water? And you can have 2 firewood?

### Human: I like to have a nice cup of tea at night before I go to bed to help me relax and sleep. I also need food to eat. You never know if you are going to get stranded and so I would like some extra food

### Assistant: Absolutely, that sounds like a real concern. How about we do 2 for 1? I just am really concerned for my kids, I have so many people accompanying me on this trip.

### Human: Ok I am willing to make it so we both win and have a great time.  I guess since you are having more people it would make sense to need more food. 

### Assistant: I agree, and I really appreciate it. So 2-1 straight down? I'll submit the deal.

### Human: Sure only so your kids can have a great time and its just me going camping. 

### Assistant: Sounds good. Thanks from all of us, I really appreciate it--and so do they. It's going to be a pretty cool time together. The youth deserve the outdoors. They're our future.

### Human: üôÇ enjoy your time. Kids grow up so fast. Have fun and Keep safe.
