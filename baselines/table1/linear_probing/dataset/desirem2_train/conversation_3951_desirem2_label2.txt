### Human: hello, how are you doing

### Assistant: I am well, how are you

### Human: i am doing pretty great

### Assistant: Great. I am going camping and would like to take some extra supplies. I would prefer to take three food, three firewood, and 2 waters if that is okay.

### Human: well that is a nice offer but you should know that i can not release all that for you to take along 

### Assistant: Why not?

### Human: if i give you three food, three firewood and two water i will not be left with much to survive on when you are away

### Assistant: You already have your basic supplies. These are just bonus supplies

### Human: yes i know they are bonus supplies but they are something i need and i can not just give them out because they are bonus supplies

### Assistant: You can survive without them. I will give you 1 of each
