### Human: hi there, i'm hoping we can come to an agreement on these extra items üôÇ

### Assistant: Hello, I would really like more food for my trip. If I can have all the food, and firewood, you can have all the water

### Human: Oh, that won't really work for me.  I was hoping to get extra food and water for this trip since I need water to take medication and would love the food to plan a special meal.  I'd like say, 2 food, 3 water and 1 firewood

### Assistant: I could give you 2 food, if I could have 3 firewood and 2 water

### Human: Hmm, how about I take 2 food and 2 water and you can have all the firewood?

### Assistant: This is fair, but I do not have any use for much firewood. I could give you 2 firewood, 2 water and 1 food

### Human: Hmm ‚òπÔ∏è.  How about 1 food, 3 water and 2 firewood?

### Assistant: I could give you 3 firewood, 2 water, but that is the most I could do

### Human: so 1 food, 2 water and 3 firewood?

### Assistant: No food, just 2 water, 3 firewood

### Human: 3 water, 3 firewood?

### Assistant: I could do 3 water, 1 firewood, if you would like more water

### Human: sure, if you throw in 1 food

### Assistant: how about 1 food, 3 water

### Human: alrighty
