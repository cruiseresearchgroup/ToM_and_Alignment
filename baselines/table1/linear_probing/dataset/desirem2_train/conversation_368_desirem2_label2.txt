### Human: We are a family of 8 among of which I have 5 juniors at a growing age with high food consumption. Thus, the need to exchange have we have, water, for the much needed food.

### Assistant: Oh i am sorry to say we have a large family as well with growing children and a breastfeeding mom. We will have to work out the food situation. 

### Human: How about I include some firewood? Remember you have the basic food in your arsenal. I would just like to exchange for the extra you have.

### Assistant: Yes i know, as you should take that into consideration as well. You said you dont need water so lets agree on me having 3 and you can have all the firewood. 

### Human: Not even to spare a package of food? ☹️

### Assistant: No i think i can take 2 food, 3 water, 0 firewood. 

### Human: Food is my most essential as well. A package is not enough for us

### Assistant: As i said we are a family of the same size. I can give you 2 but thats it, in exchange i would like 2 fire wood as we will need to hunt. So you get 2 food, 0 water, 1 firewood

### Human: Lets make it 2 food, 1 water, 1 firewood

### Assistant: Sure that sounds fair

### Human: ok
