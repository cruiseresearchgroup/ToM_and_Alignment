### Assistant: Hi, how's your day going? 🙂

### Human: I'm well, how are you?🙂

### Assistant: I'm alright. Before we get into negotiating, what are your preferences?

### Human: My priorities are food and water.

### Assistant: Okay. Mine is firewood and food. 

### Human: Okay. I don't need much firewood. Is there a reason you need extra food?

### Assistant: Mine is more so for snacks and to make some s'mores for my family - we need all the necessary ingredients for that as you can imagine.

### Human: We have 3 kids as well and have the same concerns. I'd be happy to give you 2 firewood for making s'mores.

### Assistant: Well, I was actually thinking of giving you all the food in exchange for all the firewood?

### Human: That would work. 🙂 What would you like to do with the water?

### Assistant: Whoops, my apologies. I meant all the water. We have other drinks and some water from home.

### Human: Sorry, I can't give up all the water. I don't want the kids getting dehydrated. ☹️

### Assistant: No, I meant I take all the firewood, you take all the water.

### Human: So confused... what about the food?
