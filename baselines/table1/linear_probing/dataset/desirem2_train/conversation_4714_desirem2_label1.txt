### Assistant: Hello

### Human: Hello,

### Assistant: Is there anything you would be willing to part with?

### Human: I'd be willing to part with 2 of the waters.  I don't think that it's going to be that hot, and I don't really like drinking water.

### Assistant: Hmm. I would be willing to trade you two packages of food for one water and one firewood.

### Human: Do you mean that I would get 2 firewood, 2 food, and 2 firewood??

### Assistant: In exchange of two of my food packages for one of your waters and one of your foods, you would then have 5 foods, 2 waters, and 2 firewoods.

### Human: That doesn't work.  There are only a total of 3 firewood, 3 food, and 3 water.  Can I have 2 food, 2 firewood, and 1 water?

### Assistant: I suppose I misread the instructions, or they were not very clear, I had read them as we each had 3 packages each of the 3 items. 

### Human: We each have basic camping supplies.  We need to split the additional 3 firewood, 3 food, and 3 water.  What supplies do you want the most?

### Assistant: OK. I would much prefer the firewood.

### Human: I also want firewood, but I'll give up some for additional food.  Can I have 1 firewood, 3 food, and 1 water?

### Assistant: I'm good with that, I'd rather carry wood than food.

### Human: Submit-Deal
