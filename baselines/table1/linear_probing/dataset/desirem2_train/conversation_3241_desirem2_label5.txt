### Assistant: Hello, I am a lifelong camper. My favorite part of camping is sitting by the fire at night. I propose 3 packages of firewood for me, 1 water and 1 food.

### Human: Camping's definitely something I enjoy a lot too, but I also love to cook and would want at least a little wood to make a nice meal. I'd also like to go hiking at least once while I'm out. What about 3 food, one wood, and one water for myself?

### Assistant: Well I need at least 1 food for myself. I'm very active, too. I love to hike and I imagine I would be very hungry. I need to replenish those calories.

### Human: Well remember that we both have enough food already for our trip, so this would just be some extra. Would it make you feel any better if I brought you some of the food I made? üôÇ

### Assistant: In the era of social distancing, I would rather cook my own food, but that was very nice of you to offer. 

### Human: Yeah, I definitely know what you mean there. It sounds like you're more active than me so I think we can definitely agree on you getting two of the water and me just getting one for now

### Assistant: Okay let's agree to me getting 2 water and you getting 1 water. As for the firewood, it is really important to me to get 3. Camping is my life. My parents took us camping all throughout my childhood. We loved sitting around the fire together at night and having a good time. My parents have since passed on and I really need the extra firewood to keep this tradition and memories alive. üôÇ

### Human: Sorry for your loss ‚òπÔ∏è. I can respect wanting to keep them in your thoughts with a roaring bonfire or three while you're out, but are you going alone? I'm going with a group of four so there's going to be at least someone there that will also want a bigger fire one night even if I don't.

### Assistant: I will have 3 people with me. My son, my sister and her daughter. So okay, how about I take 2 firewood, 2 water and 1 food?

### Human: I think that's pretty agreeable for covering our bases; though if your kids are young I could see you not needing two extra containers of water since you're probably not going on any short hikes. The food and fire seems respectful to both of our needs üôÇ

### Assistant: My son is 15 and my niece is 13. They are athletes. We will be doing hiking and biking. We will be needing the extra water.

### Human: Alright then; We were focusing more on canoeing with a bit of hiking on the side so I suppose I'll cede you the extra water. If it sounds good to you I'll submit my deal of 2 food, 1 water, 1 firewood now.

### Assistant: ok i think that is fair

### Human: Submit-Deal
