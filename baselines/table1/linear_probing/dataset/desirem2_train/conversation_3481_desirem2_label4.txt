### Human: Ok, so I like water a lot.

### Assistant: Yes, water is a necessity for being out camping ðŸ™‚

### Human: I agree.

### Assistant: I myself love food, so food is a big deal to me. 

### Human: Ok.  I like water over firewood.

### Assistant: Yeah, firewood isn't really something that's "essential" I'd have to say. Yeah, you need it, but still.

### Human: True. ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Seems like we'll be struggling to see who gets the firewood most of all haha

### Human: No, I like a little firewood.

### Assistant: Same here. I need it to cook my vittles ðŸ™‚

### Human: I would like to snag one package of firewood and one package of water. ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Oops, I guess we are jumping the gun! I don't see a problem with that. You are welcome to one of the firewood and water ðŸ™‚

### Human: I think two packages of food would work for me.

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
