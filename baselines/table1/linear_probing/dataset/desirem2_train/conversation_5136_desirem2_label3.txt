### Assistant: Hi! Hope you are enjoying your time outdoors. 

### Human: Hi!  So far so good.  It's been pretty hot.  I hope you are enjoying it as well.

### Assistant: Yes, it is always fun camping with the family. But I heard that the weather is going to get very cold this evening.

### Human: Same here.  I love camping.  I'm looking forward to the trip.  I enjoy the nights when they get chilly.

### Assistant: We normally do as well but it so happens we are not carrying any firewood and could not find any at the stores close by. Now we are kinda worried.

### Human: Oh no.  That's a shame.  I'm a little concerned about firewood as well.  I was hoping to be able to grab some.  I don't know if I have enough to get me through the trip.

### Assistant: We don't have any unfortunately and we have kids with us. I hope you understand ☹️

### Human: I absolutely understand.  I have kids as well. It's pretty ridiculous that the store is out of firewood 😡.  What is your plan?

### Assistant: Well we can take 2 and you can take 1 in case you absolutely need it. Else we can take the firewood if thats okay.

### Human: I could consider that.  I'm worried about running out of firewood.  Would you be willing to send over 3 of your waters if I gave you 2 firewood?  

### Assistant: I will be willing to give you 2 waters if i get 2 firewoods. We can do with 1 water I think but we will need at least 1 water

### Human: Ok.  So 2 firewoods for 2 waters.  That works for me.  And we can agree that we are both good on food?

### Assistant: how many foods would you need?

### Human: I would need one from you at most.

### Assistant: Okay. So I take 2 firewoods, 1 water and 2 foods and you take 1 firewood, 2 waters and 1 food. Is that okay?

### Human: That works for me.
