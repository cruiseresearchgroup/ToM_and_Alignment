### Human: Hello. I hope you are looking forward to a wonderful  time camping. I know this is going to awesome. My friend joe is coming up and I am looking forward to spending some time in the great outdoors.ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: That sounds like fun.  I am bringing my young son and want to make sure he is well taken care of so I want to make sure I have enough supplies to make sure he is warm and safe.  How about if I take 2 waters, 2 food and 1 firewood.

### Human: Joe is bringing pleany of steaks so I can give all 3 he did forget the water through so maybe we can trade food for the water. ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Well, I really don't feel comfortable with less than 2 waters, but since you will need the firewood to cook the steaks, I would be willing to give up the firewood if you want to let me keep all 3 food.

### Human: Ok that sounds good to me. So I get 1 water and 3 firewood. ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Are you sure that all you want is steaks to eat.  You might need some other food to keep you going.

### Human: I'm sure. We will be alright we are manly men LOL. ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: That's good to know, but now that I am thinking about it, we might need some firewood if it gets cold at night, and you all being manly men won't need the heat as much as we do.  How about I give you take 2 waters and 2 firewood and I will take 3 food, 1 water and 1 firewood?ðŸ™‚

### Human: Umm. We are going to need all that fire wood we didn't Bing any sleeping bags.

### Assistant: That's too bad, but I can't risk not having any firewood to keep my young son warm at night.  Maybe you and Joe can collect some fallen branches to add to your 2 firewoods to make them last longer.ðŸ˜®

### Human: This doesn't seem very fair to me at all.ðŸ˜¡ You said you were willing to give up all the firewood if I would give up all the food. now you want more thing.

### Assistant: I am just trading you 1 water for 1 firewood.  That seems very fair.ðŸ˜®
