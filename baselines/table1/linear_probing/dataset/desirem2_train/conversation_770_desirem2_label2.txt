### Assistant: hi there

### Human: Hello.  How are you?

### Assistant: not too bad, looking forward to a good camping trip ðŸ™‚

### Human: Yes!  This camping trip is going to be great!  I hope to make it very memorable.

### Assistant: indeed.  anyways, I would like to divide the extra supplies equitably

### Human: I think we can defintiely work together and come up with a great solution and both get what we need

### Assistant: do you have a particular item preference?

### Human: I do.  I have been looking everything over and feel this won't be to hard to come to an agreement

### Assistant: Well my camp places a premium on water.  How would you feel about for me: 2 water, 1 food, 1 firewood?

### Human: I think we're on the right track.  I am bring my 2 kids with me and they eat everything in sight.

### Assistant: Would they be okay with 2 food?  Otherwise can give you an extra and I can take either an additional water or firewood ðŸ™‚

### Human: I have a great offer.  How about I take 2 food, 2 firewood and 1 water and you will get the extra water your camp needs!!

### Assistant: We place a premium on the water.  That's the same amount of water, do you mean we take 3?

### Human: I do need some extra water.  So I will need to take 1, but our preference is food and we would need firewood to cook it on.  if you're OK with this, I will submit it.  Its a great deal I think and we'll both get what we need

### Assistant: my counter then is 2 water, 1 food, and 2 firewood for us and we are set ðŸ™‚

### Human: We're really going to need that extra firewood.  We'll need the heat source, but also for cooking.  It a big deal that I get the extra wood, I hope you will understand why I need it.
