### Human: Hi, I think I have enough firewood already so I am willing to give you all of the firewood if you give me more of the food or water.

### Assistant: I also think I have enough firewood. I would trade you two fire wood for 1 water

### Human: That sounds fair.  If I do that, then would you be willing to let me have 2 packages of food? 

### Assistant: I will give two packages of food  i nstead of 1 water .

### Human: So how does this sound....I get 2 packages of food, 1 package of water, and 1 package of firewood?  I have five children with me on this trip so I am the most concerned about nobody getting too hungry!  üôÇ

### Assistant: No. You give me 3 packages of firewood.and I give you  2 packages of food and 1 water.

### Human: I think that would work.  Do you really think you need all three packages of firewood though?  If you said you already had enough firewood then why take all three? ‚òπÔ∏è

### Assistant: Yes i think it's fair. I need food and water yet I am parting with 2 packages of food and 1 water. Just trying to be fair and help you our since you have extra people with you. You can find firewood in the wild if need be.

### Human: That is true, I appreciate the tip.  Hopefully it will be dry enough to use in the fire.  

### Assistant: Is it final then?

### Human: Yes that sounds good to me!  Enjoy your camping trip.  üôÇ
