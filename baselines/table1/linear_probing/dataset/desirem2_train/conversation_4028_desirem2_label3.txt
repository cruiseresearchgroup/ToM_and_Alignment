### Assistant: Hello! I'm packing for my camping adventure.

### Human: I am too.  I am so looking forward to this.  

### Assistant: Yes! I am so on the same page as you. I want to be sure I'm set and prepared. 🙂

### Human: Would you consider letting me have 2 of the 3 extra firewood?  I have health issues and I get really cold sometimes.☹️

### Assistant: Yes, I think that would be very fair, since I don't have health issues myself. Would you allow me to have 2 of the 3 food items? I need energy for hiking. 🙂

### Human: That would be perfect.  I am a gourmet cook and if you would like me to help you prepare the evening meal, I would be very happy too.🙂

### Assistant: That's so nice of you! I would be delighted to have some great meals during this camping vacay. 🙂🙂

### Human: I have managed to bring pouches of some of my favorite seasonings.  I'm hoping to find some great wild mushrooms in the forest too.  

### Assistant: I'm a big fan of well seasoned food and mushrooms! Mmm.. 🙂 Do you think it would also be alright for me to have 2 of the 3 waters since I will be hiking a lot?

### Human: That would be fine.  I was hoping to have 2 but since I am only walking and you are doing more heavy duty hiking, you take them.  Agreed?

### Assistant: I really appreciate that. Do you think you will be okay with just 1 water since you have health issues?

### Human: That would be very nice, but I worry about you not having enough on the trail.  Dehydration would not be good.  I am pretty sure I can ration my supply to make it last.  🙂

### Assistant: You're a good friend! I'm excited to embark on this adventure! 🙂🙂🙂

### Human: Me too!  So let me clarify:  I will take 2 firewood, 1 water and 1 food.  You will take 1 Firewood, 2 water and 2 food.  Is that right.  🙂🙂🙂
