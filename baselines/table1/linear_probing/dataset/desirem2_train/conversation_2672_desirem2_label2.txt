### Assistant: Hello there, how are you doing today?

### Human: Doing well how are you?

### Assistant: Great thank you. I am looking for primarily some firewood and food for my camping trip soon. 

### Human: I'm going camping too and also need food and wood, mostly food though

### Assistant: Okay I understand that! Is there a particular reason that you do not need much water?

### Human: I figure I could always get some at the stream ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Yes, I agree, but are you aware of the water quality at your campsite? 

### Human: Not completely aware but I do have a filter that I brought from home. What are your needs?

### Assistant: Ok me too! I am concerned the most with firewood as it is the basis for my camping activities: campfire, story telling, and producing heat. 

### Human: OK so how about you take 2 firewoods and 1 food

### Assistant: That works for me. May I have two waters since I have more of a need of water

### Human: That works for me since I have the filter!
