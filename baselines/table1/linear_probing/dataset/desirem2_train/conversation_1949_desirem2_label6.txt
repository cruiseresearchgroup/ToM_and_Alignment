### Assistant: good afternoon

### Human: Good afternoon as wellðŸ™‚ðŸ˜¡

### Assistant: what is your top preference

### Human: Water as i'm diabetic and extra fresh water is important for my health

### Assistant: I have health conditions as well, so i really need enough food to stay well.

### Human: That's fair, I have no problem with you taking most if not all of the extra food

### Assistant: Me too, I am more than happy to let you take most of the water. I hope we can make a fair deal to help each other outðŸ™‚

### Human: Same here, what's your thoughts on dividing the firewood?

### Assistant: let's do this quickly, i don't mind taking 1 and you take 2.

### Human: OK, no argument here. How is my taking 2 waters and you 1?

### Assistant: how about you take all 3 water, and i take all 3 food

### Human: That's more than fair, 3 waters me, 3 food you, 2 firewood me, 1 firewood you, deal?
