### Human: Hi! Ready for camping?! ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Hello. Of course I am ready. I've been excited for months now.

### Human: Me too! I know how you feel! What are you bringing?

### Assistant: I'm bringing water, firewood, and food. How about you?

### Human: Yes, me also. I need some things more than others, and I need to do some trading. ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: I need water and firewood mostly. What do you need?

### Human: Firewood for sure! I don't need water really. I sterilize well and stream water.

### Assistant: Are you willing to make a trade with me?

### Human: Yes, please. Would you like to have all of my water? ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Yes. I will give you 1 food package for it.

### Human: How about your firewood? Do you need all of it?

### Assistant: I need firewood. I will give you 1 firewood, and 1 food package for your water packages. How does that sound?

### Human: I really need more than 1 firewood. I go through it really quickly, especially with sanitizing my water.

### Assistant: I need firewood to keep me warm at night and to cook my food.

### Human: Okay, so if you need more than 1 firewood, I'll take 2 food, and 2 water?

### Assistant: I thought you didn't need water? I give you 1 food, 1 firewood for your 3 water packages. How does that sound?

### Human: I just want to make sure the trade is fair. There are 3 of each, so how about this.. for you 1 firewood, 1 food, 3 water and for me 2 firewood, 2 food, 0 water.

### Assistant: Submit-Deal

### Human: Reject-Deal

### Human: Submit-Deal

### Assistant: Reject-Deal

### Assistant: Submit-Deal

### Human: Reject-Deal

### Human: That's a pretty unfair deal. I guess we can't make an agreement?

### Assistant: How about this deal?

### Human: Submit-Deal

### Assistant: Reject-Deal

### Assistant: Submit-Deal

### Human: Reject-Deal

### Human: No sorry. I'd rather walk.

### Assistant: It is a 3 for 3 deal. I give you 1 firewood, 2 food. You give me 3 waters.

### Human: But in the end you have 7 items and I have 2.

### Assistant: Can you do math? I'm giving you 3 items. You give me 3 items. It's a fair deal.

### Human: I can. With my deal I have 2 firewood and 2 food, and 0 water, which equals 4. You have 1 firewood, 1 food, and 3 water. That equals 5. How do you like my math?

### Assistant: I will trade you my 2 Food + 1 Firewood for 3 of your Waters. Accept this or I will walk away.

### Human: You don't understand how this works. I can help you. We have to split 9 items. You can have 5, I will take 4.
