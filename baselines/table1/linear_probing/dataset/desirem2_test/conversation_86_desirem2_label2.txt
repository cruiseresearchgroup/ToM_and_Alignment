### Assistant: Hello there. I'd like to discuss making a deal.

### Human: yes, what would you like?

### Assistant: I was thinking I will take all the food and water. You can have the firewood. 

### Human: that's not going to work for me. I need to keep at least 2 foods and 1 firewood but you can have all the water.

### Assistant: Are you most interested in the food? 😮

### Human: yeah I didn't pack enough for my trip, so I'm a little worried about my supplies.

### Assistant: I see. I wouldn't want you to go hungry. ☹️

### Human: thank you for that.

### Assistant: I'm glad we seem to have come to an agreement. This camping trip is going to be fun!

### Human: I'm so excited! So just to be clear: you get 1 food, 2 firewood, 3 water

### Assistant: Yes that sounds good to me! Enjoy your trip. 🙂
