### Human: i am interested in firewood and fooad as well.what if i take 2 firewood and 1 food while you take 1 firewood and 2 food?let me know what you think

### Assistant: I really could use two of the firewood even more than the food. it's supposed to be pretty cool when we're going, and i need to make sure i can always keep the fire going. 

### Human: same here for me too.you can even have all the water as well.but i need to keep my family warm and give them food as well

### Assistant: I'm in the same boat. So you're saying for me to take 1 firewood, 2 food and 3 water?

### Human: yes while i take 2 firewood 1 food.i would be okay with that

### Assistant: Could we switch the firewood and food part? You can have 2 food and 1 firewood and I'll take 2 firewood and only 1 food?
