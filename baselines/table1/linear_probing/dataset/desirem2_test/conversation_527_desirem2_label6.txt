### Human: Can you spare some water? I need to take medication and I have run out.

### Assistant: Hi there, that sounds important. Yes, we can make sure you get some water. How does 1 package sound?

### Human: I'd rather have 2, can give you all of my food for all of your water?

### Assistant: I actually got really dehydrated on my last camping trip, so don't want to be completely without water. How about 2 for you, 1 for me?

### Human: That is good, is it possible that I could get some firewood as well? I may be suffering from hypothermia.

### Assistant: Oh wow! I don't want you to be that cold! :o  If I can have 3 food, I'd be happy for you to have 2 firewood.

### Human: That would be great, I'm not real hungry, so I can spare some food.

### Assistant: That sounds fair to me! So we've got 2 water and 2 firewood for you, 3 food and 1 each water and firewood for me.

### Human: Yes, you're very kind. I desperately need some more water and firewood.

### Assistant: I'm glad we were able to work out something for both of us! I hope you have a great camping trip!
