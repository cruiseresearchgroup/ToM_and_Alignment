### Assistant: Hi! Ready to start negotiating?

### Human: Hello.  Ready to go ðŸ™‚ 

### Assistant: My highest priority item is water. I am a type 1 Diabetic and therefore I get extremely thirsty and dehydrate quickly throughout the day. What is your highest priority?

### Human: My highest priority is food.  I'm taking 12 girl scouts camping.  We are learning to cook while camping.  I really want them to have a great camping experience and learn to be independent. 

### Assistant: That works well because my lowest priority is food. I propose that I only take one and you get the other two.

### Human: I will give you all the water if I can get all the food.

### Assistant: That's a deal. I am on a very strict diet and believe I will be able to find alternative food sources.

### Human: Well, I will need firewood to cook the food, so I can give you 1 of the food back if I can have all of the firewood.  I want them each to start a fire.  

### Assistant: I get cold very easily due to low iron and hypothyroidism. Staying warm is a necessity for me. I need one package of firewood and you take the rest? Your girl scouts can huddle for extra warmth.

### Human: We do love to sing and huddle.  ðŸ™‚  So I would trade all my water for all your food, and you would get one firewood?  

### Assistant: I am good with that!

### Human: Great!  Enjoy your trip.  ðŸ™‚  Keep hydrated and warm to stabilize your blood sugar.  Thanks a bunch.
