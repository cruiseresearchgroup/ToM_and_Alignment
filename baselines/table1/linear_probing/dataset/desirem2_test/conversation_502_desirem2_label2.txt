### Human: Hello!  I am gearing up to go camping this weekend?  Are you also planning to go camping?

### Assistant: Hello .  . yes, we're going to Joshua Tree NP to do some rock climbing.  What are your preferences for extra supplies?üôÇ

### Human: Nice!  I'm going to go in the Allegheny mountains in Pennsylvania?  My main priority is food because we will be doing a lot of hiking and will need to refuel our bodies.

### Assistant: I see.  I would most prefer the water--we are in a hot, desert climate without much natural water sources.I also need food, however, as we are in a large group with lots of college students--big appetites!  I would like to take the waters, one food package, and one firewood.

### Human: Let's start with the food first.  Would you be interested in keeping all of the waters and I would keep all of the food packages?

### Assistant: That is possible, but the problem is that I don't think I would have enough food.  We would have to do some hunting probably to have enough food.  I would be willing to give up all the food but I would need to take two firewood  to help cook the game.  The nights in the desert can be cold, too, so I think the firewood would help.

### Human: How about I keep 2 food packages and you keep 1 package?  Does that sound workable?

### Assistant: It is workable if you throw in at least 1 firewood.üôÇ

### Human: So you want me to take 2 firewood and you get 1 firewood ?

### Assistant: Yes, I can give up two firewood and two food for 3 waters packs, 1 food, and 1 firewood.

### Human: Would I be able to get a water pack and you keep two? I'm not sure if I can make it without atny water?

### Assistant: Sorry, that won't work for me‚òπÔ∏è I am running out of time.  I ask you to reconsider this last offer.  If we don't come to an agreement we will both suffer.
