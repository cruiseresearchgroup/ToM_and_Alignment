### Human: HI!! Hows it going? are you as into camping as I am?

### Assistant: I love to camp. I love a good campfire at night to make smores and sing around. ðŸ™‚

### Human: I know thats right-  I used to really look forward to starting the fire, and cooking on the open flame-

### Assistant: We just got back yesterday from a 5 day trip to the lake. We had a campfire almost every night. We took lots of water to drink also. I would like to have at least 2 waters and 2 firewood.

### Human: Thats dope- The thing is, we plan to cook with the firewood, so I really need what I have.  I was thinking I would need at least 2 or 3 myself.  Water isn't as much of an issue- we have a filter, and tablets if that breaks.

### Assistant: I understand needing it to cook with. It does take a lot of food when you go camping to fulfill those calories you burn when hiking.

### Human: True that- what is it you are going to be doing? What do you really think you need?

### Assistant: Well, I could probably live with 1 Firewood just for the evening. I would like at least 2 water. How much food do you think you would eat? Are you a pretty hungry person? ðŸ™‚

### Human: I am a former chef- I am always snackin on something- I could maybe live with 1 food and 1 water, but I need a lot of firewood going into this trip...

### Assistant: Where do you like to camp? Will you be in the woods with more firewood?

### Human: We are going to medicine bow national park, most of our trip is going to be a site in the snowy region, which is above the timberline.  We are making a base camp, then taking day trips to different climbing, and hiking attractions.

### Assistant: We will be near the water, but there are lots of trees around and I can get more firewood. I would be fine with 1 firewood, 2 waters, and 2 food to keep me happy. ðŸ™‚
