### Assistant: Hello!

### Human: Hello, how are you doing today?

### Assistant: i am doing great! how about you?

### Human: I'm doing pretty well, just preparing for this camping trip.

### Assistant: ME as well! we are a group of big eaters, and are looking to take lots of food.

### Human: That is fair as there is no showers or sinks at my campsite so I am looking to take water :) 

### Assistant: We will likely also need to take water too. Need to be able to wash up.

### Human: That is fair, I also will need a good bit of firewood to keep warm as the campsite is in a colder area.

### Assistant: We dont care much for campfires. Leaves your cloths smelling for days!

### Human: Alright so I think we can make a fair deal here where we both will be happy ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Submit-Deal

### Human: Reject-Deal
