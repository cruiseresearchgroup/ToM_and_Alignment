### Assistant: Hey, would you like to take more firewood in exchange I'll get more food? Just in case I get lost and would need to ration out my portions. 

### Human: I understand where you're coming from. I would really need the most water. 

### Assistant: I am willing to give you the most water if I am able to have the most food.

### Human: Well I need some food because what if I get lost as well? 

### Assistant: I understand that, but walking away with the most food and the most water would essentially leave me for dead lol. Do you prefer water or food? 

### Human: I prefer to have the most water as I have a medical condition that requires me to stay extremely hydrated at all times. If I get too dehydrated, it's extremely bad for me. How about I get 3 water and 1 food, and 2 firewood?

### Assistant: I'll give you the 3 water, 1 firewood. How about I get 3 food and 2 firewood? I'll need the fire to cook my food.

### Human: I would need firewood to cook my food as well. I would like the 3 water, 1 food, and 1 firewood, what about that? 

### Assistant: Since the value of water exceeds both food & firewood, I think it's fair for me to receive the extra dose of firewood. My offer to you is: you get 3 water, 1 food,  0 firewood.  I would get 0 water, 2 food, 3 firewood.

### Human: Okay you have a deal.

### Assistant: Great. I'll send it over 

### Human: Submit-Deal
