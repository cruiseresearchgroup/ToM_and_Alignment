### Human: Hello there! How are you today?

### Assistant: I am fine . How about you?

### Human: I am doing well so far. 🙂 What items are of preference for you today?

### Assistant: I need a lot of food today. I was advised to eat at least 4 times a day so i may need all the food packages.

### Human: Well that is not going to work well for my family of 8 now is it? Haha. I think we can come to some sort of agreement though.🙂

### Assistant: What do you propose?

### Human: I really need food too, but I am willing to deal and let my kids go hungry I guess ☹️ I propose I get one food, 3 firewood and 1 water.  

### Assistant: Will you please give me one firewood? I may run out of what i have. Just one.

### Human: I think I will need all the firewood since you are taking 2 foods. I will need to hunt and cook food from the land meaning I need my fire going all the time.

### Assistant: I need one more to light a fire to scare away animals. Please😮

### Human: Then How about I get two foods, 1 firewood and 1 water?

### Assistant: Like i said food is my top priority so i will not do well with less than 2.

### Human: Then you get two food and no firewood here.😮

### Assistant: You mean you can't let up one firewood for me?
