### Assistant: i really need to keep my energy up, so having a lot of food is important to me.

### Human: I understand, is there anything else you need?

### Assistant: I'd like some firewood, too, and maybe a little water.

### Human: I guess we are in the same boat.

### Assistant: which items do you need?

### Human: Food is most important, I have to cook for the group

### Assistant: What if I give you one of the food and two of the water, and also a firewood?

### Human: That's not bad

### Assistant: That way we all get some of everything. 

### Human: Well yes but if i am cooking the firewood is more important than the water

### Assistant: What if you take one food, two firewood, and one water?

### Human: I guess the food is really important to you?  How about you give me all the firewood and you keep the water

### Assistant: Yes, the food is really important. But I can't cook it without any firewood. So I need at least 1 firewood.

### Human: Alright then give me one additional water and i can make pancakes
