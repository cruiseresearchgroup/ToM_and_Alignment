### Human: Hi. I'm most interested in water. What's your highest priority?

### Assistant: I really need water too. I have a young baby and will do a lot of washing.

### Human: Okay. I'm not especially worried about food. What's your lowest priority?

### Assistant: I have enough food too. Can I take 2 water, 1 firewood and 2 food?

### Human: How about two water, 1 firewood and 1 food, since we both value water the most?

### Assistant: Is that what you want or what you are offering?

### Human: That's what I'm offering to you, but I think it's a fair deal, so I'd accept it myself, too.

### Assistant: Fair enough.

### Human: If that sounds good, just tell me which bundle you want.

### Assistant: As you suggested, I will take 2 water 1 food and 1 firewood

### Human: Awesome

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
