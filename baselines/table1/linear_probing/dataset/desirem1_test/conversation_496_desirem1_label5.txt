### Human: How excited are you?

### Assistant: I'm so excited! And we got an extra blessing this week. We had 2 foster kids placed with us so they will be joining us for the trip! They have never been camping before, so I am super pumped for them! ðŸ™‚

### Human: Aww thats exciting! im bring my 5 month old for his first time so im excited about that!

### Assistant: Aww how fun! Love that! Since I have a few extra kiddos joining us, I am way short on food! I could really use 3 extra food packages!

### Human: I can give you the 3 food if i can get 3 water and 2 firewood!

### Assistant: Thank you so much!! As much as that would help, It would also be super helpful if I could even get 1 water. I can get by with 2 firewood. 

### Human: i really need the water for my babies formula!

### Assistant: Okay, I understand that! I want to make sure your baby has everything they need! So I can handle 3 food and a firewood
