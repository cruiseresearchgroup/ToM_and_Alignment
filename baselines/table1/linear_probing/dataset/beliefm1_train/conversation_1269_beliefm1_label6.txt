### Assistant: Hello there. I

### Human: Hello!

### Assistant: I'm interested in making a deal with you on the packages.

### Human: I think that I have some opinions about what might work best for me and be fair for us both. What is the most important to you out of the three items available?

### Assistant: I need water the most. What do you prefer?

### Human: Water is also important to me, but I think that a large amount of firewood and food could also benefit me as well.

### Assistant: I see. I don't need firewood that much. Would you like to take all of it so I can get more of the food and water?

### Human: I would still need a bit of food, but yes the firewood would help me

### Assistant: ðŸ™‚ Great! Take all the firewood then. Then I'll take a greater share of the food and water.

### Human: No, I will still need more food. 

### Assistant: You drive a hard bargain. ðŸ˜®

### Human: Submit-Deal
