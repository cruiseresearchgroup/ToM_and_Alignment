### Assistant: I have a medical condition that causes my veins to close up when I get too cold. I will thus need the 3 firewood.

### Human: ☹️Oh, that sounds awful. Are you sure you need all three packages of firewood?

### Assistant: I might be able to get by with just two... I'm on a diet though, so I don't need as much food.

### Human: That's a relief. I actually have a friend joining me and they don't have their own food supply. I don't have enough for two people.

### Assistant: You can all the food if you need it.🙂

### Human: Thanks!🙂 Do you need any water packages?

### Assistant: Yes. Since the days are on the warmer side, I'm a afraid of getting dehydrated. I would love to have all of it...

### Human: Ah, that doesn't work for me. I would need to have at least one water because one of mine has a leak (and I have an extra person joining me).

### Assistant: I guess you can have one. That gives me 2 firewood and 2 waters, and you 1 firewood, 1 water, and 3 food. Right?

### Human: Yes that would work for me. But I would also let you have all the firewood if I got 2 waters and all the food. 

### Assistant: Submit-Deal

### Human: Reject-Deal
