### Human: Hello

### Assistant: hi

### Human: what is your preference for a deal?

### Assistant: I would like to get a higher number of food.  I can give you some wood or water in exchange

### Human: If I let you win on food, I am gonna need to win on water and firewood

### Assistant: I will give you 2 wood and 2 water for any food you can give

### Human: Ok, but i really need some food aswell, I cant give it all

### Assistant: that is why I said any food you can give, even it its just 1

### Human: How about this. You get 2 food, 1 water and 1 firewood

### Assistant: And what would you like in return

### Human: 1 food, 2 water, and 2 firewood. I am not doing so well on water and in the event of an emergency, it's very important to me

### Assistant: That is fine with me.  Is that the deal that you want?
