### Human: Hi! I prefer to acquire firewood for cooking and water for hiking long trails.

### Assistant: Hello! I really need water myself--I didn't bring enough to go hiking, and it's going to be hotter than I planned for. And I really wanted to go on a long hike ‚òπÔ∏è How about this: I get all the water, and you can have all the firewood? I don't need firewood so much, really.

### Human: I really like hiking also, as i have a habit of running a lot. So i would give extra firewood and food for extra water.

### Assistant: Okay, how about this: you get all the firewood and one water, and I get two water?

### Human: For two water I will give all food and one firewood

### Assistant: No, thanks. I really need water a lot, and I don't want firewood all that much.

### Human: Okay, I like your previous deal! 

### Assistant: Cool! So, 3 firewood for you and 1 water, 2 water for me; how should we split the food?

### Human: I keep all food.

### Assistant: Okay, that doesn't work for me, because that means you get 7 items and I get 2.

### Human: Okay, well I'll give 1 food

### Assistant: Give me 2 food and we'll have a deal.

### Human: Again.3 food and 1 firewood for 2 water

### Assistant: If I don't get at least 4 items total, I'm walking.

### Human: Okay 2 water for 3 food and 2 firewood

### Assistant: How about I get 2 water and 2 food, you get 3 firewood and 2 food?

### Human: Fine. It's a dealllllll

### Assistant: Sweet! Thanks a lot üôÇ
