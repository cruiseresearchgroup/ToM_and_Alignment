### Human: Hi, How are you?

### Assistant: Good how are things?

### Human: yeah. going good.

### Assistant: good to hear

### Human: How about the deal? 

### Assistant: Sure. My kids are really looking forward to this camping trip but one has special needs and he has to have a specific diet. I am fairly flexible on the water and firewood but food is a must have for me.

### Human: Okay. then I'll choose 2 food, 2 firewood and 1 water

### Assistant: You want two food or you're allowing me to have 2 food?

### Human: I want 2 food

### Assistant: My kids need the food. If you allow me to have two food I'll give you all the firewood

### Human: okay then I'll choose 1 food 3 firewood, and 2 water

### Assistant: It's a bit skewed towards you with all those items isn't it? If you want two waters then I'll need 3 food and one water. You can have all 3 firewood

### Human: Okay then I'll choose 0 food 3 firewood, and 2 water. you choose 3 food, 0 firewood and 1 water
