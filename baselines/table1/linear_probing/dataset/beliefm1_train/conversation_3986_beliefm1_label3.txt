### Assistant: I need all three of the firewood and three water.  You can have all the food.

### Human: üòÆ May I ask why? I do need food, but I need some firewood as well.

### Assistant: I need firewood to cook the fish I plan to catch.  I don't really need more food, but I can use a little water too, since it's warm.

### Human: I need firewood, because I have a medical condition that causes my veins to close if I get too cold at night. I don't mind sharing the water.

### Assistant: Can you get by with one firewood?  If I give it up, I'll need some food, since I won't have enough to cook all the fish.

### Human: I could give you 1 firewood, 2 waters, and 1 food. 

### Assistant: If you make it two food, we have a deal.

### Human: I would rather let you have the third water than other food. I don't like fish. ‚òπÔ∏è

### Assistant: Okay, you can have two firewood and and two food, I'll take the rest.

### Human: Ok. That seems fair enough to me.

### Assistant: Looks like we have a deal!

### Human: Submit-Deal
