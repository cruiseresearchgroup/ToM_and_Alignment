### Assistant: Hi, how are you?

### Human: I am doing very well. Have you planned your camping trip?

### Assistant: A bit and you? I'm looking forward to figuring out a deal that helps us both!

### Human: That's great. ðŸ™‚ We are planning to prepare food over a fire.

### Assistant: Nice! What are your highest priority items?

### Human: We need a moderate amount of everything and I think we can work something out successfully.

### Assistant: got it, OK I'll start then. I'd like at least 2 firewood

### Human: Okay. we brought some of our own food so I don't need much of that either.

### Assistant: do you want more water then? perhaps 2?

### Human: Yes ðŸ™‚ 

### Assistant: ok great. I think I can do that, I'd like to have 2 food then if you're OK with that

### Human: Submit-Deal
