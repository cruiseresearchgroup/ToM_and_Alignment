### Assistant: hello! 

### Human: Hi! I am excited to go camping. How are you?

### Assistant: I'm good! Me too, I'm doing a lot of climbing and hiking too so that should be fun.

### Human: Yes ðŸ™‚ Since you are doing hiking, I bet you could use a lot of water...

### Assistant: Actually, I'm staying near a lake so water isn't too high of a priority for me. Food's the main one

### Human: Me too. I did not get a chance to grab lunch so I am pretty hungry now. And I eat a lot...

### Assistant: Ugh, I wish I could give you some food but I didn't pack as much as I need so I'm a little worried about this hiking trip

### Human: I can do without water but I really need to eat. How about firewood?

### Assistant: I only really need one bundle of firewood, you can take the rest.

### Human: But I still need some food... I don't want to starve all through the night...

### Assistant: I can give you one bunch of food, I can't go any higher than that though.

### Human: Ok, you get 2 food and 1 firewood. I can get the rest
