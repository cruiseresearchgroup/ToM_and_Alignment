### Assistant: Howdy, how you doing today?

### Human: I'm doing great! How are you?

### Assistant: I'm doing super. Thanks for asking!

### Human: I'm really excited for this camping trip!! 🙂

### Assistant: same. I love to fish and be outdoors!

### Human: Me too! I'm a little worried about my water situation, though. I'm newly pregnant, so a lot of foods are making me nauseous. I need to make sure that I have enough water to compensate.

### Assistant: Well, congrats! Going camping when pregnant seems crazy to me, but to each there own

### Human: I want to make sure to have a lot of fun before I get so big and miserable. Would it be okay with you for me to have all of the water?

### Assistant: Well, what do I get in return. I need water too ☹️

### Human: What do you want the most?

### Assistant: I need water the most, but since you're pregnant and need it... I'm willing to let you have it all if I get 3 and 3 of food and firewood

### Human: I can give you all of the food, but I would like one firewood, please. 🙂
