### Assistant: Hello, how are you doing?

### Human: I’m doing fine. How about you?

### Assistant: I'm doing well. I was hoping I could have the extra firewood because my group decided to camp for a few extra days and want to make sure we have enough

### Human: How many of you are on the camping grounds?

### Assistant: It's just my family. There are 6 of us total

### Human: Wow. I’m alone here. I could use an extra food and water. 

### Assistant: How many would you like? I just want to make sure we have enough good and water because there are so many of us

### Human: I understand. I would like one food and one water. How much wood do you want for that?

### Assistant: I think we could get by with two pieces of wood and I would be glad to give you the other one

### Human: So you will give me one piece of each?

### Assistant: Yes that sounds good with me if that is good with you

### Human: So I’ll give you one wood and you give me one food and one water.
