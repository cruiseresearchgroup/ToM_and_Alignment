### Human: Hi. I am fostering some children and need all the food I can get

### Assistant: You can have the food if I can have the firewood

### Human: ok that sounds good. 

### Assistant: I also need at least 2 water,  it gets to 110 degrees fahrenheit 

### Human: I also need 2 waters, as my children are parched and our water supply has been contaminated

### Assistant: If you only have children, I think you can make it off the basic water supplies

### Human: but the water is contaminated. They will get sick if they drink it!!!☹️☹️☹️

### Assistant: Just boil the water that will get rid of the contamination

### Human: would you drink water contaminated with sewage? 😡

### Assistant: I am just going to walk away then
