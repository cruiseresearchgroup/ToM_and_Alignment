### Assistant: Hello

### Human: Hello, how are you today?

### Assistant: I am doing great, how about you?

### Human: I'm doing well! 

### Assistant: I am in desperate need of food and water for camping because I have a large group of people with me

### Human: I too am in need of water because the place I'm going doesn't have access to any.

### Assistant: I guess I will have to cancel my trip and are regulations then

### Human: I would be happy to trade my food for your firewood though. We can start from there.

### Assistant: I don't need extra firewood at all because I have a lot of blankets

### Human: It is good to be prepared.

### Assistant: You can have all the firewood if I can have all the food

### Human: I can do that.

### Assistant: Since It is 120 degrees where I am going, I should take 2 water

### Human: Submit-Deal
