### Assistant: Hello, I need only 1 extra package for food because I'm not a big eater.  How do you feel about this

### Human: I understand my friend, I have three children that are growing teenagers. Would you be willing to take extra water instead?

### Assistant: Yes! But I would like 3 packages of water because I drink a Lot of water and I get dehydrated easily.  OK?

### Human: I might be able to get you 3 packages of water, if you allow me to have three packages of food.

### Assistant: OK..🙂! That's fine because I don't eat a lot and can ration what I have this is alright with me, friend.

### Human: I also need 2 packages of fire wood because my body doesn't regulate temperature well and the evenings can be quite cold. 

### Assistant: No, problem about the Firewood, because I don't get cold easily!🙂. I don't mind if you need 2 packages of firewood.

### Human: You are very generous. Thank you my friend! 🙂  The firewood will be used to heat up my baby's formula. 

### Assistant: Such a WORTHY reason - I couldn't stand in the way of such a good reason for extra firewood.  Are you readY to SUBMIT THE DEAL, ARE WE READY?🙂

### Human: I am concerned that I might not have enough water to mix the formula. ☹️ Would you be willing to accept 2 packages of water in stead of 3? If so, I am ready to submit the deal. Thank you for considering my humble request. 🙂

### Assistant: OK, I don't mind accepting 2 packages of water instead of 3, I don't feel this is unreasonable.  I see no reason to be selfish or greedy about it.  There is no reason to hoarder of water.  I can accept 2 packages of H2O.  OK?

### Human: Thanks my friend.

### Assistant: OK, Friend, I'm ready!🙂

### Human: Submit-Deal
