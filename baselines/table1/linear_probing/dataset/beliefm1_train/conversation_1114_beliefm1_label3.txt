### Human: hello

### Assistant: Good day, sir. I'm going camping and I need extra supplies. Would you allow me to have 3 firewood, 2 water, and 2 food?

### Human: okayðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Thank you so much. Are you going camping too then?

### Human: Im going camping also but I did want to back track and ask for 1 of those firewoods back please.  its for health reasons

### Assistant: I see. So that would give me 2 firewood, 2 water, and 2 food. I believe I can manage it. Is firewood what you need most?

### Human: actually it would be 1 firewood, 2 waters and 2 foods

### Assistant: Hmmm... this agreement is changing rapidly.

### Human: i actuallly meant to say that in the beginning. i wanted 2 firewoods and  you could have the 2 waters and 2 foods. and yes firewood is  the most important for me

### Assistant: What is second most important to you?

### Human:  the other two are  not important but  do we have a deal where i have 2 firewood and you have 2 foods and 2 waters?

### Assistant: Well, I would like to have 1 firewood, 3 water, and 1 food. If water and food are not as important to you, surely that will work?

### Human: yes, we have a deal. i agree,

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
