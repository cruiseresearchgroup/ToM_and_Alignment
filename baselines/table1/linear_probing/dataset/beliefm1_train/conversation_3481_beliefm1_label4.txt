### Assistant: Ok, so I like water a lot.

### Human: Yes, water is a necessity for being out camping ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: I agree.

### Human: I myself love food, so food is a big deal to me. 

### Assistant: Ok.  I like water over firewood.

### Human: Yeah, firewood isn't really something that's "essential" I'd have to say. Yeah, you need it, but still.

### Assistant: True. ðŸ™‚

### Human: Seems like we'll be struggling to see who gets the firewood most of all haha

### Assistant: No, I like a little firewood.

### Human: Same here. I need it to cook my vittles ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: I would like to snag one package of firewood and one package of water. ðŸ™‚

### Human: Oops, I guess we are jumping the gun! I don't see a problem with that. You are welcome to one of the firewood and water ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: I think two packages of food would work for me.

### Human: Submit-Deal
