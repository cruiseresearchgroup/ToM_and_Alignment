### Human: Hello, how are you? Looking forward to camping?

### Assistant: Oh yeah, that's for sure. What camping item do you prioritize?

### Human: I'm going to need some extra wood because I'm somewhat injured and can't really gather more.

### Assistant: Oh, I see. Well, I personally need lots of water to stay hydrated since I drank a lot already.

### Human: Yes, that's important. I don't need much.

### Assistant: The thing I need less, but still sort of want some of, is food.

### Human: I'm like that as well, a small appetite.

### Assistant: I need firewood the least of all though, because I have a lot of coats for warmth.

### Human: Are you bringing several coats while camping?

### Assistant: Yeah, I might even have too many.I still need water the most,so I'm thinking I should take the water and you should take the firewood.

### Human: I can deal with that. I'd rather a little thirst than being cold.

### Assistant: Okay, So I'll take all three water, you'll take all three firewood package and I'll take one food package and you get two. What do you think? ðŸ™‚
