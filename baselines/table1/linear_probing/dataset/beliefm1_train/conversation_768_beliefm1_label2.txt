### Human: hi there

### Assistant: Hello.  How are you?

### Human: not too bad, looking forward to a good camping trip 🙂

### Assistant: Yes!  This camping trip is going to be great!  I hope to make it very memorable.

### Human: indeed.  anyways, I would like to divide the extra supplies equitably

### Assistant: I think we can defintiely work together and come up with a great solution and both get what we need

### Human: do you have a particular item preference?

### Assistant: I do.  I have been looking everything over and feel this won't be to hard to come to an agreement

### Human: Well my camp places a premium on water.  How would you feel about for me: 2 water, 1 food, 1 firewood?

### Assistant: I think we're on the right track.  I am bring my 2 kids with me and they eat everything in sight.

### Human: Would they be okay with 2 food?  Otherwise can give you an extra and I can take either an additional water or firewood 🙂

### Assistant: I have a great offer.  How about I take 2 food, 2 firewood and 1 water and you will get the extra water your camp needs!!
