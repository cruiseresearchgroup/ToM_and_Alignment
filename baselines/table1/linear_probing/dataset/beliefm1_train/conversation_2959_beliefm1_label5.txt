### Human: Hello.. what material do you have? I would like to sort out a deal so we can both win

### Assistant: Hi there. I really need a lot of food, a bit of water, and I don't need any firewood at all. What about you?

### Human: I really need firewood, a bit of water, and I don't really need food. It seems like we can make a great deal and both leave with what we need 

### Assistant: Oh that is perfect! How about 3 firewood, 2 waters, and 0 food for you then?

### Human: How about 3 firewoods, 2 waters, and 1 food, just in case I can't find any food on my own.

### Assistant: I can't really do that since I truly need a lot of food ‚òπÔ∏è

### Human: You're right. I realize that we have 3 each.. so it sounds fair. So you will have 3 foods, 1 water, and 0 firewood?

### Assistant: yes! that sounds perfect to me!

### Human: It sounds good to me as well. So our final deal will be 3 wood, 2 water, and 1 food for me, and 3 food, 1 water, and 0 firewood. 

### Assistant: No no. 3 wood, 2 water, and 0 food your you! 

### Human: Oops. Sorry üòÆ! Hahaha! I keep forgetting. 

### Assistant: No worries hahaha. Thank you!
