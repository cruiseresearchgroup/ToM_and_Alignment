### Assistant: Hello i was thinking that i could get 3 firwoods? What are your thoughts?

### Human: Hello, I was thinking you are crazy ðŸ™‚.  I would also like firewood as I am naturally a very cold person so I need as much warmth as possible.  I live in the heat and I still use a heavy blanket to stay warm.  My termperature range is very small as I also sweat alot so I'll need lots of water as well.  How about you?

### Assistant: okay what if you let me get 2 firewoods. I need a little more because where we are going its gets very cold. I will give you 2 waters if i could get 2 firewoods.

### Human: I think I could survive on 1 firewood, but I would need all the waters and a little extra food.  When I drink water, I always need something extra to go with it.  How does 1 firewood, 3 water, and 1 food for me sound to you?

### Assistant: okay i can understand that what if i gave you 2 foods and i get at least 1 water?  

### Human: That sounds reasonable - I can take 1 firewood, 2 waters, and 2 food.  That will at least keep me somewhat warm and hydrated.  I'll just have to remember to pack more firewood..

### Assistant: Great! I just have to make sure i use my water wisely

### Human: Agreed.  I think there's a creek in the area so maybe bring some water purifiers that will make the water potable.  You can also use the firewood to heat up the water.

### Assistant: oh yea that a great idea, So you get 1 firewood and i get two and  you get 2 waters and i get 1 and you get 2 foods and i get 1 correct? 

### Human: That's correct - Sounds like we'll both have a fun trip ahead of us.

### Assistant: yes can't wait. So we have a deal!?

### Human: Submit-Deal
