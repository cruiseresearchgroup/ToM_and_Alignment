### Human: Hey!  I hope you're having a good week and staying well.  So we are negotiating on supplies! ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Yes. Hoping we can make a good deal.

### Human: Me too!  I'm hoping for two food items and one water.  I'm diabetic so if my blood sugar drops, I may need the extra carbs.  And water because water is important! ðŸ™‚ 

### Assistant: I prefer two water and one food. I can understand why you need the extra food items. I'm not much of a snacker but do drink a lot of water all the time. Keeps me from eating more!ðŸ™‚

### Human: Lol, it seems it was easy for us to come to a deal!  I'm super bad at drinking water (trying to get better) so I don't feel I'll need as much.  Do you want all of the firewood or should I take one and you take two?  

### Assistant: I don't have a preference on the firewood. You may have two if you like. It's so hot that I don't cherish the idea of a fire BUT it does keep the bugs at bay!ðŸ™‚

### Human: Ooh, I didn't think of that!  I'm not a huge fan of fire but I'm even less a fan of bugs.  I'm good with two in that case.  I think we still have to meet the 10 message minimum before we can submit a deal.  So how's your day going?

### Assistant: So far, so good but it is too hot outside to enjoy. I have been watering the garden and trying to convince my dog to come out and play but she is not interested.

### Human: Lol, it's hot here too!  We are always in the 110-118 degrees out in the desert.  What kind of dog do you have?

### Assistant: She is a Corgi with a fluffy coat so she is not a big fan of the heat. I guess you get a dry heat near the desert. We have a lot of humidity which is oppressive. Hoping it will be cooler on our camping trip!

### Human: Oh yeah, it's really dry here.  I sort of prefer that.  I haven't been in humidity much but it's so gross feeling.  Corgis are adorable!  Okay, I think we're ready to make a deal.  It was so nice chatting with you!

### Assistant: Same here! Thanks for your cooperation. It was so nice to chat with you. Stay safe, well AND cool!
