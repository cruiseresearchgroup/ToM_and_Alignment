### Assistant: Hi, I need lots of firewood and food - is water important to you?

### Human: Hey, how are you?  Food is important to me, but so is water.

### Assistant: I'm good.  Hope all is well and safe with you as well.  Yes, firewood is important to me because I need it to cook the fish and meat that we brought on the trip.

### Human: I understand, that makes sense! I can let you have more, or most firewood.  I need some amount of both food and water though.  We don’t have enough of either.  ☹️

### Assistant: Sounds good.  I can let you have more of or the most water.

### Human: That seems like a good deal.  I can probably get by with just 1 food if i can have 3 water.

### Assistant: Sure.  Would I be able to have 3 firewoods?

### Human: Could i have 1 firewood so we can be warm at night?

### Assistant: Sure.  That works.  So I get 2 firewoods, 2 foods, 1 water?

### Human: Hmmm, i thought i got 1 food, 1 wood and 3 water 😮

### Assistant: Oh ok.  That works too

### Human: Great, i’ll propose it
