### Assistant: What are your preferences?  I always love having a big fire at night when I am camping and I do think water is more important than food.

### Human: I like to have a lot of food to keep my energy up, but I might need some firewood to cook that food. I can't wait for my camping trip.ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: I love camping also!  Yes, I can see how you would need firewood if you want to cook your food.  So, food is more important to you than water?

### Human: Yes, I will need a little water to wash that food down with though. Are you going to be needing a lot of water?

### Assistant: Yes, I may need more water.  I am on a diet and I don't really cook either!  Hopefully we can work something out here.

### Human: That sounds great. I probably need to go on a diet, but I like my food to much. LOL

### Assistant: Well, I am pre-diabetic, so I had to do it for my health. I love food, too...especially sugar!  ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚

### Human: Oh, that does change things a lot. Diabetes is a hard disease to have to deal with. So you want more firewood than water? And less food than water?

### Assistant: Well, I don't know.  I think I would like more water than firewood, but yes less food than water.  I'm a pretty easy going person though! ðŸ™‚

### Human: Ok, let me know what you think and we will go from there. I do prefer more food and firewood than water though.

### Assistant: Okay, it sounds like we are pretty agreeable here.  I will wait for you to make an offer if you would like to.
