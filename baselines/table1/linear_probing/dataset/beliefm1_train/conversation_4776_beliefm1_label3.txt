### Human: I would really like some extra firewood to keep the chill off on those cold  nights.üôÇ

### Assistant: Me too. It has been rather cold lately! But I am also really interested in water.

### Human: I don't need the water as much.  How about I get 2 firewood and you get 2 water?

### Assistant: I would prefer all the water. You can have all of the firewood.

### Human: That sounds good to me.  What about the food?

### Assistant: I would like 2 food, but you may have one. I wouldn't want you to be too hungry!

### Human: I don't want to be too hungry either but I think perhaps I might need an extra water to compensate for the lack of food.

### Assistant: Since I am giving you all of the firewood that you said was most important to you, I feel I should get at least the same amount of items as you, especially since you are getting exactly the firewood you want. I will need to stick to three waters and two food.

### Human: The firewood is most important to me to be sure. However, if you get more food and all of the water I could end up going hungry.‚òπÔ∏è

### Assistant: Well I would be happy to exchange you one of your firewood for the one water you need. That way you won't go thirsty.

### Human: Hmm, no I think I will agree with your first arrangement. I get 3 firewood and 1 food.

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
