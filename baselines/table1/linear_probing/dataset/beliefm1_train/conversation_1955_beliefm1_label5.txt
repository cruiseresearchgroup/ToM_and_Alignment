### Human: Hi, how are you today

### Assistant: Super.  So happy I can fly.

### Human: Thats great. Do you have any extra firewood you could trade by any chance?

### Assistant: Sure, I want to make sure I have one firewood at a minimum. 

### Human: What would you want in return?

### Assistant: I like to eat.  I think extra food is good.  Are you willing to let me have all three food packs? ðŸ™‚

### Human: I would want to keep at least one packet of food for myself, unless you want to just swap 3 firewoods for 3 packets of food, to keep it simple?

### Assistant: I like your plan.  It is simple. I will agree to that.

### Human: So all that is left is water, i guess i should atleast drink alot of it if i wont eat much haha ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: For sure, and you will need some way to put out the fire. ðŸ˜®

### Human: Haha good point, you worked with me on the firewood so i am ok with you getting two waters and i will get one, deal?

### Assistant: I think that is generous of you.  Thank you and I agree.
