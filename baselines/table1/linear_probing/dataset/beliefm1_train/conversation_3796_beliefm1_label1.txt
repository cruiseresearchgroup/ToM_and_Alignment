### Human: Hi, im pretty excited about camping, what about you?

### Assistant: Yea I am too.

### Human: i am camping in a pretty damp jungle area, so i would like 3 firewoods please, and maybe 1 of either food or water, your choice

### Assistant: I think we should split the gear evenly so everyone can be happy.

### Human: Well if i take 3 firewood, and one of something else, i only get 4 items, you get 5. i think that is fair

### Assistant: Yes but you are rushing it too quick my friend.

### Human: I see what you mean.ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: What are your most important items?

### Human: Firewood, what about you?

### Assistant: Me too unfortunately

### Human: well in that case, you can have all the fire wood, if i can have all the water and 2 foods, that way you get all three of your most important item

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
