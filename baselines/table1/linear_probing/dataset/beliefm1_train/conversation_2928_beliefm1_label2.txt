### Human: My husband and I and our three kids. My oldest daughter is also pregnant.

### Assistant: You have quite the crew! I have 3 children with me. What is your top item needed?

### Human: We really need water.

### Assistant: Ok great, we have plenty of water and there is a lake nearby. You can have all 3 water. I would like to get 2 food packages. 

### Human: Okay. I can agree to that if I can get 2 firewood.

### Assistant: We are not in a very wooded area, I am not sure 1 firewood would be enough. 

### Human: I can let you have 2 firewood.
