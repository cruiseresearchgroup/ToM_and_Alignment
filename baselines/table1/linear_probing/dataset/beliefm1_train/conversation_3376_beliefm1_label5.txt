### Human: I will need 2 firewood, 2 water and 1 food

### Assistant: How about you take all the firewood because I have the skills necessary to chop down more. I also will need three packages of food because I will be climbing a very tall mountain.

### Human: well i do need alot of firewood since i need it to start a fire

### Assistant: Okay, so you can take all the firewood and I take all the food. I will also need at least two waters because I had a limited supply at home.üôÇ

### Human: no, i will need 2 water because i need to drink it and there not much water around me

### Assistant: Please work with me. I will need plenty water to make it to the top of the mountain.

### Human: i am already giving you all 3 food which i also need to eat

### Assistant: Would you be willing to trade a piece of firewood for an extra water bottle? That will save me some time from chopping down extra wood.

### Human: no, best i can offer is i get 3 firewood, 2 water and 1 food

### Assistant: No thanks.‚òπÔ∏è

### Human: ok, last deal, i get 3 firewood, 1 water and 1 food

### Assistant: That sound fair to me since I will need plenty food and water for my climb.
