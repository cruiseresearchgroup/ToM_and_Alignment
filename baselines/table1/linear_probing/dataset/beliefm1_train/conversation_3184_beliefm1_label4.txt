### Assistant: Hello to you!

### Human: Food is the most important item for me because the food I brought has spoiled! Which item do you need the most?

### Assistant: I need water above all else.

### Human: Oh, that works for me. I don't need much extra water. 🙂

### Assistant: Exccellent.

### Human: So I take all 3 packages of food and you take all 3 packages of water?

### Assistant: How about I take 2 packs of water, you take 1 pack. I take 1 pack of food and you take 2 packs of food

### Human: Well, I would rather not. I might starve if I don't have all 3 packages of food ☹️

### Assistant: how much firewood do you need

### Human: I would like 2

### Assistant: I will  be happy to let you have 3 packs of food , but I need 2 packs of firewood
