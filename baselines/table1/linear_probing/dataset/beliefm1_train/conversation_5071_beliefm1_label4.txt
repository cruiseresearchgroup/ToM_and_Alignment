### Human: hy thats my offer

### Assistant: Hi there.. I'm sorry, I didn't see your offer as it doesn't show it for 10 messages, I believe.  So, here's the situation.. I think I can get by with less firewood as I'm a Floridian and prefer it cooler anyway.. also the food is not a huge thing for me as we can catch / improvise around the campsite - but I'm definitely interested in as much water as possible.. both for cooking and cleaning purposes, as well as drinking, of course.  üôÇ

### Human: okay so what do you suggest

### Assistant: Well, I recognize you're gonna need water too.. so I'd love to take 2 of them, giving you one and I'm totally ok with going 1 on the firewood and one on the food.. that way we all ensure we have enough.. you're making out a bit better in quantity that way but I think its best for both of us üôÇ

### Human: i botttle of water for a can of food and 2 firewoods

### Assistant: Yeah, sorry, that's not going to work out for me.  I'm going to need at least 2 bottles of water, 1 food packet, and one firewood.. again, this does leave you with two each on the food and the firewood, which are both very important things for this camping trip!

### Human: but thats the only offer im willing to give

### Assistant: Well then unfortunately I think we're gonna have to walk away from this and neither of us gets anything we could both use.. that's unfortunate and I'm sorry to see it end in such a less than magnanimous fashion ‚òπÔ∏è

### Human: you need water and i need food so unless we do 1 food  to 1water is tht okay

### Assistant: I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.. I can't really budge on the water.. BUT.. I could do something where I take 2 water, and only one firewood, but two food.. does that work for you?

### Human: so if i were to  give you water what would i get ?

### Assistant: You'd be getting 1 water, 2 firewood, and 1 food
