### Human: Hi I would like to trade you food for some water 🙂

### Assistant: How many food would you like to trade for water?

### Human: How about 2 Water for 3 food?

### Assistant: That sounds like a good deal but I could use some firewood as well. Would you throw one of those in as well?

### Human: That doesn't seem very fair ☹️. That would be 3 food and 1 firewood for 2 water. That is 4 items exchange for 2.

### Assistant: Ok what if I throw in 3 waters in exchange for 3 food and 1 firewood? So it is a 4 - 3 exchange instead.

### Human: Actually I changed my mind , lets just do 3 food for 3 water?

### Assistant: Well that is a little promising but I would really like some firewood as it makes me nice and warm and keeps the camp going 🙂.

### Human: I can do 2 firewood for 3 water if that is better for you?

### Assistant: Actually that does sound a lot better I would be willing to do that. So 2 firewood for 3 water?

### Human: Yea but what about the food?

### Assistant: Oh right, how about you get 3 waters , 2 food and 0 firewood. And I'll get 3 firewood and 1 food?

### Human: That sounds like a good deal to me 🙂

### Assistant: Submit-Deal
