### Assistant: Hello! ðŸ™‚ I would like to start off the offer with you can have 1 water and ALL 3 firewood. ðŸ˜®

### Human: Hi there. What about the food? I am bringing teenagers with me, so I was hoping to have all three food and at least two water.

### Assistant: ðŸ˜® Ill need at least two food, I am a diabetic and food and water are essential to keep my blood sugar within a range that I will be able to function, without it my mental status changes, and unless those teens want to see an interestingggg show I need food and water

### Human: Understood. How many people will be with you?

### Assistant: We are a family of 3, and have 2 dogs, the dogs will not require food from this package, but will need someof the water

### Human: We are also a family of 3 ðŸ™‚. But my son is bringing three friends. Have you ever fed four teenage boys? ðŸ˜® Lord help me! That is why I was hoping to have more food.

### Assistant: I can't even imagine! What if we do you can have two food, 1 water and since I have the dogs that love to run and play, Ill take 1 food and 2 water

### Human: That sounds great! How would you like to split the firewood? My son loves to build campfires.

### Assistant: With taking less food my sugar will be low, in that state I will be very cold. My wife knows when my sugar is dropping just based on how many blankets I need, even in the summer haha! 

### Human: Would you like all three then? My son and his friends can gather sticks and broken pieces in the woods.

### Assistant: Sounds like a great compromise! It was nice working with you, will be such a fun time! 

### Human: Submit-Deal
