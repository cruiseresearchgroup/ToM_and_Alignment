### Human: Hello! how are you doing today

### Assistant: Hello! I am well. How are you?

### Human: Excellent! thank you for asking

### Assistant: I am in extra need of food and water. You see, I have a baby and a toddler who eats often! Would you be willing to lend me 3 foods and 2 waters?

### Human: I see your need for plenty of water and food, but that's just too much to ask. I am making a huge bonfire with my friends, so I do need the firewood. How about 3 firewood and 2 water

### Assistant: I could use some firewood as well. How about 2 firewood for you, 1 food and 1 water?

### Human: how about 3 firewood and 1 food for me

### Assistant: i'm good with that. I really need water to make my baby's bottle. Can I have two waters?

### Human: You can have all the water and 2 food. that's my offer

### Assistant: that works well with me, thanks!

### Human: Ok deal
