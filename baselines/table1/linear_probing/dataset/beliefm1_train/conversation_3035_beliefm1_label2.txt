### Assistant: Do you have any prefrences?

### Human: I would like to have extra food and water - I will collect firewood on site.  Which items do you prefer?

### Assistant: I would also like to have some extra food and i would also like to collect fire wood, I woudnt mind some extra water but it doesnt seem nessesary to me right now. Can I offer 1 food, 3 waters and a fire wood. you would get time to focus on other tasks instead of walking around for wood the first day. üôÇ

### Human: I don't feel right about taking all of the water.  I can sacrifice some of the food but I have some blood sugar issues and need to eat to stay on an even keel.  How about as a counter offer I get 2 foods, 2 waters and only 1 firewood?üôÇ

### Assistant: I understand, I wouldnt want to disrupt your physical well being but we have an unexpected tag a long coming with us and were needing some extra food to accommodate them. We have the ability to fish onsite, would you possibly be able to stay with one food and accommodate the rest through fish? I would like to try but we are scheduled for group activities with little time to spend on the beautiful lake fishing? My counter is 1 food, 2 waters and 2 fire wood.

### Human: I think you are making sense and I am starting to get where we are headed.  I think it is fun to have tag a longs so I don't want to make that harder.  How about 2 foods and 2 waters and then I forfeit all of the firewood?  With all that firewood you could have a big bon-fire. üôÇ

### Assistant: I didnt understand how much is going to me? If  I understood correctly I will be getting 2 foods 2 waters and 3 firewoods?

### Human: Sorry - did not mean to confuse - I was looking at getting 2 foods and 2 waters for myself.  You would end up with 1 food, 1 water and 3 firewoods.  

### Assistant: ‚òπÔ∏è I would like to keep working at this, is there an offer we can agree on that would leave me with two foods?

### Human: I can do that - I will go for 1 food, 2 waters and 1 firewood.  That will leave you with 2 foods, 1 water and 2 firewoods.  I feel good about submitting that deal.üôÇ

### Assistant: I also agree to that deal, thank you! I will submit it now!

### Human: Submit-Deal
