### Assistant: I would really like 2 packages of firewood and 2 of food. But I can do with one package of water. 

### Human: Okay I can agree to 2 of the water.

### Assistant: I already don't drink much water so I can get away with 1. üôÇ I am worried about not having enough food because I am pregnant. 

### Human: I can give you all 3 of the food, if you can give me 2 of the firewood because I am going somewhere really cold and need the wood to make fires.

### Assistant: I would worry about you not having any food! I am always cold and feel like I will be freezing and lose to much body heat if I don't have enough firewood. 

### Human: I am not worried about food, I have plenty but I need at least two of the firewood for where I am going.

### Assistant: I'm not sure how to make that work. ‚òπÔ∏è I wonder if the extra food would help keep me warm?

### Human: You would still have one of the firewood but a good amount of food since you are pregnant. Perhaps you could bring warm soups or cocoa.

### Assistant: Yes, that might work! Maybe my extra fat will keep me warm! üòÆ

### Human: So we can do 3 food for you, 1 water, 1 firewood, and 0 food for myself, 2 water, and 2 firewood?

### Assistant: I would be happy with that if you think you will be okay with it! üôÇ

### Human: Yes

### Assistant: Thank you so much. It has been a pleasure dealing with you. I hope you have a great trip!

### Human: Submit-Deal
