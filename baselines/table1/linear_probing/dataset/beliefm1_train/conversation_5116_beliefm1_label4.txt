### Assistant: Hey how's it going?

### Human: Not bad, yourself?

### Assistant: Pretty good. The kids are looking forward to this weekend's camping trip. 

### Human: I see, thankfully I do not have any.

### Assistant: yeah we got a lot of things planned for them at the campgrounds. they're going to be pretty busy

### Human: So what is your main focus this trip?

### Assistant: one of my kids is on medication so we are going to need to pack a lot of water. so if could spare that it would be appreciated.

### Human: Well sadly I plan to go hiking a lot so I will need lots of water, but perhaps we can come to a reasonable agreement if I have to shorten my hikes.

### Assistant: ok what do you have in mind?

### Human: Well if I gave you a majority of the water, I would like 1 water, 3 firewood and 1 food.

### Assistant: so I would have 2 water, 2 food and 1 firewood? My kids were looking forward to making s'mores. If I could get 2 water, 2 firewood and one food, that would be great!

### Human: You would get 2 water and 2 food, I would get 1 water and 1 food for hiking and 3 firewood for having to stay out longer in the dark to complete my hiking goals.
