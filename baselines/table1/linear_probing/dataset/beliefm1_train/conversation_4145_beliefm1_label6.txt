### Assistant: Hello! I want to make a purchase of some essential needs for me and my family.

### Human: Hello, the trip sounds like it will be a lot of fun.  What is the most important essential package for you and your family?  I know we didnt bring a lot of food so I am looking for more of that than anything else.

### Assistant: Yes! Hope for lot of fun. Is there any special deal can you offer for maximum order.

### Human: What item are you looking for the most of?  

### Assistant: Water and food is on high need than the firewood. Expect for the best combo for food and water.

### Human: I brought plenty of water.  I think I could give you all 3 water. Food is what I need the most of so wonder if I took 2 packages of food and left you 1?

### Assistant: It's better to give 2 packages on both 

### Human: 2 packages of both of what?  Water and food?

### Assistant: I mean water and food

### Human: Is food something you need the most of or is it water?

### Assistant: I need 2 packages of both food and water on each

### Human: Food is a hard one to give 2 packes of since I dont have very much and need to feed my family.  We do have plenty of water though.  Would you be willing to take 3 packages of water and only get 1 package of food?

### Assistant: Is any other item is left with you to add 

### Human: I would be willing to give you 3 water, 1 food, and 1 firewood which we be 5 packages for you.  I would take 2 food and 2 firewood which would be 4 packages for me
