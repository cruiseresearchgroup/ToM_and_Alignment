### Human: Things are okay. I got my ribs broken the other day. But I'm looking forward to a camping trip with my boy üôÇ.

### Assistant: Oh... Well what do you need for the trip. Maybe we can share something.

### Human: I really am looking for 3 firewood and 3 water. What are you looking for?

### Assistant: In that case, I would like 3 firewood, 3 water and 3 food.

### Human: Of course, I cannot do that‚òπÔ∏è. What do you need most and what do you need less of?

### Assistant: I need firewood the most.

### Human: Same. What do you need second most?

### Assistant: water

### Human: Same. I'll give you two firewood, if you give me one. And you give me two water and you take the rest. The food we can split.

### Assistant: so I'll be 2 firewood, 1 water, 2 food?
