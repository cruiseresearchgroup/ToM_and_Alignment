### Assistant: Hi, I brought some water with me. How much do you need? 

### Human: I want 2 liters of water

### Assistant: Okay, you can take two and I will take one. 

### Human: Okay that's great

### Assistant: Can I take all three bundles of firewood so I can boil some of the water? 

### Human: Sorry, I want some firewood, I planned to enjoy this chill climate using firewood

### Assistant: Alright. If you take one firewood can I also have two packages of food? 

### Human: That doesn't work for me, May I ask why do you need two packages of food?

### Assistant: I did not bring enough food for my last day and there are not very many resources where I am camping ‚òπÔ∏è

### Human: Okay, If it is the case then you need food. How about you take all 3 food and I will take all firewood

### Assistant: That works with me. Can you list everything you are taking so we can make sure we are on the same page? 

### Human: I will take 3 firewood, 1 food, 2 water. You will get 0 firewood, 2 food and 1 water. Is everything correct

### Assistant: Sure, sounds like a deal!

### Human: That's great üôÇ shall we end the deal?
