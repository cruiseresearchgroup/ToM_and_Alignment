### Assistant: What are your preferences for water?

### Human: Water is not something I want to haul on my camping trip.  I would like to haul extra wood though.  

### Assistant: I would actually prefer more water

### Human: That is great.  Looks like we are on our way to making a deal.  How do you feel about wood?  

### Assistant: I would prefer less wood so that's great

### Human: I do not like camping and find comfort in food, so I would like to take all the extra food that I can.  

### Assistant: I think that can be negoiated then i tend to eat less on camping trips

### Human: Great!  So looks like all the water goes to you.  I will take all the food if that is ok and we can split the wood.  

### Assistant: Well i would need one food and one wood

### Human: OK.  I think that will work out for me.  You get 3 water, 1 wood and 1 food.  I will take the rest.

### Assistant: Great that's an agreement for me

### Human: Submit-Deal
