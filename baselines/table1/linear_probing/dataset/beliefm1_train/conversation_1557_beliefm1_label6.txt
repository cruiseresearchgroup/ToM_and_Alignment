### Assistant: Ok, what item do you need the most and which item do you need the least? That information would help me think of an offer that suits both of us.ðŸ™‚

### Human: I need   food and water the most . There are 3 of us.ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Your most needed item is water or food?

### Human: Most needed is both food and water. I guess food is my highest priority .ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Ok perfect, the item I need the most is water because I need to hydrate.  What do you think if I give you 2 food and I keep 2 of water. 

### Human: Ii understand , the problem  is ctheere is 3 of us. What if  we have 2 food and 2 water and you have 2 firewood ?ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: The object I need the most is WATER, so I cannot give you 2, I am giving you 2 FOOD since it is what you most need. Remember that we must both be satisfied for this to workðŸ™‚

### Human: (sorry for the misspellings on above post, my keyboard does that) Ok since that  is your highest priority , I have 2 food 1 water and 2 firewood ? Is that agreeable ?ðŸ™‚
