### Assistant: Hello.  I really would like two packages of extra food, one water, and one firewood.  How does this sound to you?

### Human: Hello. I would like 3 packages of water, 2 firewood, and 1 food. 

### Assistant: I would really like one of the waters.  Could we come to a deal with you getting 2 waters, 2 firewood and 1 food?

### Human: I am agreeable to that. I can compromise by giving you a water.

### Assistant: Thanks. I thought extra food was the most important when camping

### Human: Well in my case I wanted water most because I bring more food. And I like the firewood for cooking and I love campfires ðŸ™‚

### Assistant: Campfires are great, I only need a small one though.

### Human: Good. Then it seems we can help each other out for mutual benefit

### Assistant: Exactly, it is so nice when negotiations go smoothly.

### Human: I agree. Thank you for being reasonable. 

### Assistant: Thank you!  Have a great camping trip ðŸ™‚

### Human: Submit-Deal
