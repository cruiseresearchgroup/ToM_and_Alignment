### Human: Hello how are you today? üôÇ Do you have any initial ideas on how to split everything? 

### Assistant: I was thinking maybe I could have a majority of the fire food and you can have a majority of the water and food. 

### Human: What exactly do you mean by majority? As in everything ?

### Assistant: I was more thinking 2 Firewood for me , 1 food and 1 water? The rest would be yours.

### Human: That is a promising bargain but I want at least 2 firewood, it makes for a fun time for my group.

### Assistant: Interesting , because my group feels the same way though. How does your group feel about water though?

### Human: Water is not that important for us but the firewood is a deal breaker for us ‚òπÔ∏è

### Assistant: I see.... Well we really would like the firewood too though. Could you reconsider it makes a big difference for us.

### Human: Sorry I will only consider a deal if I can get at least two fire wood.

### Assistant: Well if that is the case then I want 1 Firewood 3 waters and 2 Food then. 

### Human: That is kind of excessive though.... 6 - 3 of an item share? 

### Assistant: Well you wanted the firewood so take it or leave it.

### Human: Can we do 5 - 4? and 2 fire wood , 1 food and 1 water for me?

### Assistant: Noüò°
