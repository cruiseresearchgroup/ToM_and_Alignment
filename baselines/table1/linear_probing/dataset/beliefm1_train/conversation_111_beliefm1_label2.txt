### Human: I would like to get 3 of the extra food packets and 1 firewood

### Assistant: Hello. How are you. That is a lot considering my issue that I have - I need to eat or at least snack something multiple times a day, otherwise I won't be able to function on this trip üòÆ. I was hoping to get 3 food as well. Not sure if I could do 2.

### Human: Oh maybe we can work something out, I need the extra food packets as my children will be with me. Even if I dont eat, I need for them to have plenty. Could I get 2 food packets and 2 of the firewood packs?

### Assistant: I could possible consider 2 firewood packs if I get all 3 food?

### Human: I cant give up the 3 food packets, my kids will starve. The most I can do is give you 1 food packet, 1 firewood and 2 of the extra waters

### Assistant: I might not be able to go to the trip then. I understand that we all do get basic packets already. Unfortunately - as I said - I would be not able to function there properly. I understand your concern but I am sorry.‚òπÔ∏è

### Human: Well if we walk away we both suffer, lets try to think about all that is involved. Unfortunately, we cant split the 3rd food packet. I think I should take the 2 food packets since children are involved. How can we split the rest of the items to make it fair.

### Assistant: I cannot even think further about getting anything. I know I will suffer if I go without these supplies. So for me it would be not good one way or the other. Plus Firewood is another crucial thing because I get so cold and would need to constantly keep warm. So these two things both are crucial.

### Human: How about this I will share 1 food packet with my kids. I would need 2 firewood packs, and the 3 extra waters. That way you can have the 2 food packets üôÇ

### Assistant: In that case you are getting way more supplies. This is why I was already saying earlier - one way or the other I would suffer because Firewood is also so important. And if I am not getting more food - that is also not good, because water can help with food cravings. ‚òπÔ∏è

### Human: That deal would give you 2 food packets, and 1 extra firewood. That is a fair trade-off

### Assistant: 3 - 6? I don't consider that fair, I am sorry.
